            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SO great a number of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of Surgery, as well Ancient as Modern, have been already publiſh'd, that a plenary Satisfaction ſeems to have been long ſince given on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, even to the Judgment of the moſt curious Inquirers: But if it be conſider'd that a young Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon ought always to have in view the firſt Principles of this Noble Art explain'd after a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and intelligible manner, it will be ſoon acknowledg'd that there is good reaſon to ſet about
<pb facs="tcp:39065:3"/>the Work anew: For beſides that the Writings of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents being ſo voluminous, are not portable, they are alſo very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate and confus'd; nay the whole Art has been ſo far im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd and brought to perfection by able Maſters in the preſent Age, that they are now almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unprofitable.</p>
            <p>Some Modern Authors have ſet forth certain ſmall Tracts, which only explain a few Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical Operations, and on that account deſerve only the Name of Fragments. Indeed the Works of ſome others ſeem to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently compleat, but are printed in ſo large Volumes, and contain ſo many Diſcourſes altogether fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign from the principal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb facs="tcp:39065:3"/>that they have almoſt the ſame Inconveniences with thoſe of the Ancients. Therefore the Reader is here preſented with a ſmall Treatiſe of Surgery, yet very plain and perſpicuous, in a portable Volume; being free from a Multiplicity of impertinent Words, and containing every thing of moment that has been produc'd by the moſt approv'd Authors both Ancient and Modern.</p>
            <p>An Introduction is made into the Matter by ſmall Colloquies or Dialogues, to the end that the young Student may be at firſt lead as it were by the Hand; but as ſoon as he has attain'd to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Progreſs in theſe Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, this innocent and puerile manner of ſpeaking is abandon'd,
<pb facs="tcp:39065:4"/>to conduct him in good earneſt to the moſt ſublime Heights of ſo admirable an Art; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, after having penetrated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its firſt Rudiments and Grounds, he is well inſtructed in Anatomy, and furniſh'd with a general <hi>Idea</hi> of Wounds and Tumours, which are afterward treated of in particular: He is alſo taught a good Method of curing Wounds made by Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, the Scurvy, and all ſorts of Venereal Diſeaſes: From thence he is introduc'd into the Practice of all manner of Chirurgical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations in Fractures and Luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; together with the uſe of their reſpective Dreſſings and Bandages.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:39065:4"/>
            <p>At the end of the Work is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a <hi>compleat Chirurgical Diſpenſatory,</hi> ſhewing the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of preparing ſuch Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Compoſitions as are chiefly us'd in the Art of Surgery; ſo that upon the whole Matter; it may be juſtly affirm'd, that this little Manual has all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Writings on the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and is altogether free from their Superfluities and Defects.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of Chirurgical Inſtruments, portable and not portable.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>WHAT do you call portable and not portable Inſtruments?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Portable Inſtruments are thoſe which the Surgeon carries in his Lancet-Caſe with his Plaiſter-Box; and not portable are thoſe that he doth not carry about him, but is oblig'd to keep at home; the former being appointed for the ready help which he daily adminiſters to his Patients, and the others for greater Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the Inſtruments which a Surgeon ought to have in his Plaiſter-Box?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Inſtruments are a good pair of <hi>Sizzers,</hi> a <hi>Razor,</hi> an <hi>Inciſion-Knife</hi> ſtreight and crooked, a <hi>Spatula,</hi> a greater <hi>Lancet</hi> to open Impoſtumes, and leſſer for letting Blood. They likewiſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeparately in very near Lancet-Caſes, a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Probe</hi> made of Silver or fine Steel; as alſo many other Probes, ſtreight, crooked, folding, and of different thickneſs; a <hi>Pipe</hi> of Silver or fine Steel, to convey the cauterizing <hi>Button</hi> to a remote Part, without running the hazard of burning thoſe that are near it; another <hi>Pipe</hi> or <hi>Tube</hi> ſerving inſtead of a Caſe for <hi>Needles,</hi> which have Eyes at one end for ſowing; a <hi>Carlet,</hi> or thick triangular Needle; a ſmall <hi>File;</hi> a Steel Inſtrument to cleanſe the Teeth; a

                  <hi>Fleam;</hi> a pair of crooked <hi>Forceps</hi> to draw a Tooth; a <hi>Pelican;</hi> a <hi>Crow's Bill;</hi> ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Raſpatories;</hi> a <hi>Hook</hi> to hold up the Skin in cutting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the Inſtruments which a Surgeon ought to keep in his Repoſitory to perform the greater Operations?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of them are peculiar to certain Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and others are common to all. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments appropriated to particular Operations, are the <hi>Trepan</hi> for opening the Bones in the Head or elſewhere: The <hi>Catheters</hi> or Probes for Men and Women afflicted with the Stone, or difficulty of making Water. <hi>Extractors,</hi> to lay hold on the Stone in <hi>Lithotomy,</hi> and to gather together the Gravel; large crooked <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion-Knives,</hi> and a <hi>Saw,</hi> to make Amputations of the Arms or Legs; great <hi>Needles</hi> with three Edges, to be uſed in making <hi>Setons;</hi> ſmall <hi>Needles</hi> to couch Cataracts; other <hi>Needles;</hi> thin <hi>Plates</hi> and <hi>Buckles</hi> to cloſe a Hair-Lip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May not the Salvatory be reckon'd among the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Inſtruments?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, becauſe the Balſams, Ointments, and Plaiſters contain'd therein, are means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Surgeon makes uſe to reſtore Health.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>WHAT is Anatomy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the <hi>Analyſis</hi> or exact Diviſion of all the Parts of a Body, to diſcover their Nature and Original.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is requiſite to be obſerv'd by a Surgeon before he goes about to diſſect a Body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things; <hi>viz.</hi> The external Structure of the Body, and the Proportion or Correſpondence between the outward Parts, and thoſe that are within.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why ſo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe without this exterior and general Knowledge, the Surgeon wou'd be often mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in the Judgment he is to paſs concerning a Diſlocation or Wound, inaſmuch as it is by the Deformity which he perceives in the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he knows the Diſlocation, as it is alſo by the means of the Correſpondence which the outward Parts have with the inward, that he is enabled to draw any certain Conſequences rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to a Wound, which penetrates into the Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Part?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is that whereof the whole Body is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and which partakes of a common Life or Senſation with it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>How many ſorts of Parts are there in a Humane Body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may well reckon up Fifteen diſtinct Parts, which are the Bone, the Cartilage, the Ligament, the Tendon, the Membrane, the Fibre, the Nerve, the Vein, the Artery, the Fleſh, the Fat, the Skin, the Scarf-Skin, the Hair, and the Nails.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Bone?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the hardeſt and drieſt Part of the whole Body, and that which conſtitutes its principal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Cartilage or Griſtle?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a yielding and ſupple Part, which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the Nature of a Bone, and is always faſten'd to its Extremities, to mollifie and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate its Motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Ligament?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Membranous Contexture uſually ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Bones to contain them; as alſo ſometimes to other Parts, to ſuſpend, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in their proper place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Tendon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the Tail or Extremity of the Muſcles, made by the re-union of all the Fibres of their Body, which ſerves to corroborate it in its Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to give Motion to the Part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Membrane?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Nervous Part, the uſe whereof is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn and ſecure the Cavities of the Body on the inſide, and to wrap up or cover the Parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Fibre?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are fleſhy Lines of which the Body of a Muſcle is compos'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Nerve?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a long, white, and thin Body, conſiſting
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39065:10"/>of many Fibres, enclos'd within a double Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, and deſign'd to carry the Animal Spirits into all the Parts, to give them Senſe and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is an Artery?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Canal compos'd of Four Coats, that carryeth with a kind of Beating or Pulſe even to the very Extremity of the Parts, the Blood full of Spirits, which proceeds from the Heart, to diſtribute to them at the ſame time both Life and Nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Vein?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Canal made likewiſe of Four Tunicles, which receives the Arterial Blood, to carry it back to the Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is Fleſh?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Part which is form'd of Blood thicken'd by the natural Heat; and that conſtitutes the Body of a Muſcle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is Fat?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a ſoft Body made of the Unctuous and Sulphurous part of the Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the</hi> Derma <hi>or Skin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Net compos'd of Fibres, Veins, Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Lymphatick Veſſels and Nerves, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the whole Body, to defend it from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of the Air, and to ſerve as an univerſal Emunctory: It is very thin in the Face, ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe to the Fleſh, and is pierc'd with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of imperceptible Pores, affording a Paſſage to inſenſible Tranſpiration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the</hi> Epiderma, <hi>or Scarf-Skin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a ſmall fine Skin, tranſparent and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, having alſo innumerable Pores for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of Sweat, and other Humours by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39065:11"/>Tranſpiration: It is extended over the whole inner Skin, to dull its too exquiſite Senſe, by covering the Extremities of the Nerves which are there terminated. It alſo renders the ſame Skin even and ſmooth, and ſo contributes very much to Beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the Hair?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hairs are certain hollow Filaments plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Glandules of the Skin, from whence their Nouriſhment is deriv'd. They conſtitute the Ornament of ſome Parts, cover thoſe which Modeſty requires to be conceal'd, and defend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the injury of the Weather.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>HOW is the Humane Body divided before it is diſſected, in order to Anatomical Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Anatomiſts diſtinguiſh it into <hi>Similar</hi> and <hi>Diſſimilar</hi> Parts, appropriating the former Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to all the ſimple Parts of the Body taken ſeparately, as a Bone, a Vein, a Nerve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they attribute the Name of Diſſimilar to all thoſe Members that are compos'd of many Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or Simple Parts together; ſuch are the Arms,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39065:11"/>Legs, Eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein are contain'd all at once, Bones, Veins, Nerves, and other parts.</p>
               <p>Others divide it into <hi>containing</hi> and <hi>contained</hi> Parts, the former encloſing the others, as the Skull includes the Brain, and the Breaſt the Lungs; whereas the contained Parts are ſhut up within others; as the Entrails within the Belly, the Brain within the Skull, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others again divide the whole Body into <hi>Spermatick</hi> and <hi>Sanguineous</hi> Parts; the former being thoſe which are made at the time of Formation; and the latter all thoſe that are grown afterward by the Nouriſhment of the Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Are there not alſo other Methods of dividing the Humane Body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes: Many Perſons conſider it as a Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Bones, Fleſh, Veſſels and Entrails, which they explain in four ſeveral Treatiſes, whereof the firſt is call'd <hi>Oſteology,</hi> for the Bones; the ſecond <hi>Myology,</hi> for the Muſcles; the third <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giology,</hi> for the Veins, Arteries, and Nerves, which are the Veſſels; and the fourth <hi>Splanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology,</hi> for the Entrails.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, the moſt clear and perſpicuous of all the Diviſions of the Body of Man, is that which compares it to a Tree, whereof the Trunk is the Body, and the Branches are the Arms and Legs. The Body is divided into three <hi>Venters,</hi> or great Cavities, <hi>viz.</hi> the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Middle, and the Lower, which are the Head, the Breaſt, and the lower Belly. The Arms are diſtributed into the Arms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, the Elbow and Hands; and the Legs in like manner into Thighs, Shanks,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39065:12"/>and Feet: The Hands being alſo ſubdivided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Carpus</hi> or Wriſt, <hi>Metacarpium</hi> or Back of the Hand, and the Fingers; as the Feet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Tarſus, Metatarſus,</hi> and Toes. This Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is at preſent follow'd in the Anatomical Schools.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>WHY is Anatomy uſually begun with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Skeleton, or Contexture of Bones?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe the Bones ſerve for the Foundation, Connexion, and Support of all other Parts of the Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the Skeleton?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a gathering together, or Conjunction of all the Bones of the Body almoſt in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Situation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From whence are the principal differences of the Bones derived?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are taken from their Subſtance, Figure, Articulation, and Uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is all this to be underſtood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt then, with reſpect to their Subſtance, there are ſome Bones harder than others; as thoſe of the Legs compared with thoſe of the Back-Bone. Again, in regard of their Figure, ſome are long, as thoſe of the Arm; and others ſhort, as thoſe of the <hi>Metacarpium.</hi> Some are alſo broad, as thoſe of the Skull and <hi>Omo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platae</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:39065:12"/>or Shoulder-Blades; and others narrow, as the Ribbs. But with reſpect to their Articulation, ſome are joined by thick Heads, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into large Cavities, as the Huckle-Bones with thoſe of the Hips; and others are united by the means of a ſimple Line, as the Chin-Bones. Laſtly, with relation to their Uſe; ſome ſerve to ſupport and carry the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as the Leg-Bones, and others are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to grind the Meat; as the Teeth; or elſe to form ſome Cavity, as the Skull-Bone, and thoſe of the Ribs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the Parts to be diſtinguiſhed in the Bones?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are the Body, the Ends, the Heads, the Neck, the <hi>Apophyſes,</hi> the <hi>Epiphyſes,</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyli</hi> or Productions, the Cavities, the <hi>Supercilia</hi> or Lips, and the Ridges.</p>
               <p>The Body is the greateſt Part, and the middle of the Bone; the Ends are the two Extremities; the Heads are the great Protuberances at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities; the Neck is that Part which lies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately under the Head; the <hi>Apophyſes</hi> or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes are certain Bunches or Knobs at the Ends of the Bones, which conſtitute a Part of them; the <hi>Epiphyſes</hi> are Bones added to the Extremities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bones; the <hi>Condyli</hi> or Productions are the ſmall Elevations or Extuberances of the Bones; the Cavities are certain Holes or hollow places; the <hi>Supercilia</hi> or Lips are the Extremities of the Sides of a Cavity, which is at the End of a Bone; the Ridges are the prominent and ſaliant Parts in the length of the Body of the Bone.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:39065:13"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>How are the Bones join'd together?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two ſeveral ways, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Articulation</hi> and <hi>Symphyſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How many ſorts of Articulations are there in the Bones?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are generally two kinds, <hi>viz. Diarthroſis</hi> and <hi>Synarthroſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is Diarthroſis?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diarthroſis</hi> is a kind of Articulation which ſerves for ſenſible Motions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How many kinds of Diarthroſes, or great Motions are there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are Three, <hi>viz. Enarthroſis, Arthrodia,</hi> and <hi>Ginglymus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Enarthroſis</hi> is a kind of Articulation which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites two Bones with a great Head on one ſide, and a large Cavity on the other; as the Head of the Thigh-Bone in the Cavity of the <hi>Iſchion</hi> or Huckle-Bone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arthrodia</hi> is a ſort of Articulation, by the means whereof two Bones are join'd together with a flat Head receiv'd into a Cavity of a ſmall depth. Such is the Head of the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Bone with the Cavity of the <hi>Omoplata</hi> or Shoulder-Blade; and that of the Twelfth <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Back with the firſt of the Loins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ginglymus</hi> is a kind of Articulation which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites two Bones, each whereof hath at their Ends a Head and a Cavity, whereby they both receive and are received at the ſame time, ſuch is the Articulation in the Bones of the Elbow and the <hi>Vertebrae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is</hi> Synarthroſis?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Synarthroſis</hi> being oppoſite to <hi>Diarthroſis,</hi> is a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39065:13"/>cloſe or compacted Articulation, deſtitute of any ſenſible Motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How many ſorts of</hi> Synarthroſes, <hi>or cloſe Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are Three, <hi>viz. Sutura, Harmonia,</hi> and <hi>Gomphoſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Suture</hi> is that which joins together two Bones by a kind of Seam or Stitch, or by a Connexion of their Extremities diſpos'd in form of a Saw, the Teeth whereof are recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally let one into another: Such are the Sutures of the Skull-Bones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harmonia</hi> is the uniting of two Bones by a ſimple Line; as the Bone of the Cheek with that of the Jaw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gomphoſis</hi> is a kind of cloſe Articulation, which unites two Bones after the manner of Nails or Wooden Pins fixt in the Holes made to receive them: Such is that of the Teeth in their Soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is</hi> Symphyſis?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Symphyſis</hi> is the uniting of two Bones by the interpoſition of a <hi>Medium,</hi> which ties them very ſtreight together, being alſo threefold: Such is the Connexion of the Knee-Pan or Whirl-Bone of the Knee, and the <hi>Omoplata</hi> or Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Blade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Are not theſe three kinds of Articulations or</hi> Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſes <hi>diſtinguiſh'd one from another?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes; for tho' they are all made by the means of a third Body intervening, which joins them together; nevertheleſs every one of theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Bodies gives a different Denomination to its reſpectivé Articulation: Thus the Articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is caus'd by a Glutinous and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilaginous
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:39065:14"/>Subſtance, is properly call'd <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondroſis;</hi> as that of the Noſe, Chin, <hi>Os Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, &amp;c.</hi> But an Articulation which is made by a Ligament is termed <hi>Synneuroſis,</hi> as that of the Knee-Pan. Laſtly, that which is wrought by the means of Fleſh, bears the Name of <hi>Syſſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſis;</hi> as the Jaw-Bones, the <hi>Os Hyoides,</hi> and the <hi>Omoplata</hi> or Shoulder-Blade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Have the Bones any ſenſe of Feeling or Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have neither; for their ſenſe of Pain proceeds from nothing elſe but their <hi>Perioſtium,</hi> or the Membrane with which they are cover'd, and their Motion is perform'd only by the Muſcles that draw them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doth the Marrow afford any Nutriment to the Bones?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, all the Bones are nouriſh'd by the Blood, as the other Parts; but the Marrow is to the Bones what the Fat is to the Fleſh; that is to ſay, it is a kind of Oil or Unctuous Subſtance, which moiſtens, and renders them leſs brittle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Are all the Bones of the ſame Colour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, they follow the Temperament and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How many in number are the Bones of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Skeleton?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two hundred and fifty uſually rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd, <hi>viz.</hi> 61 in the Head, 67 in the Trunk or Cheſt, 62 in the Arms and Hands, and 60 in the Legs and Feet; but the true Number can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be exactly determin'd, by reaſon that ſome Perſons have more, and others fewer; for ſome have more <hi>Oſſa Seſamoidea,</hi> Teeth and Breaſt-Bones
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39065:14"/>than others: Again, ſome have many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentings in the <hi>Lambdoidal</hi> Suture, and others have none at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Can you rehearſe the Number of the Bones of the Head?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are Fifteen in the Skull, and Forty ſix in the Face.</p>
               <p>The Fifteen of the Skull are the <hi>Coronal</hi> for the fore-part of the Head; the <hi>Occipital</hi> for the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-part; the two <hi>Parietals</hi> for the upper-part and each ſide; the two <hi>Temporals</hi> for the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; the <hi>Os Sphenoides</hi> or <hi>Cuneiforme,</hi> which clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the <hi>Baſis</hi> or bottom of the Skull; the <hi>Os Ethmoides,</hi> or <hi>Cribriforme,</hi> ſituated at the Root of the Noſe; and the four little Bones of the Ear on each ſide, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Incus</hi> or Anvil; the <hi>Stapes</hi> or Stirrup; the <hi>Malleolus</hi> or Hammer; and the <hi>Orbiculare</hi> or Orbicular Bone.</p>
               <p>Of the Forty ſix of the Face, Twenty ſeven are counted in the Upper-Jaw, <hi>viz.</hi> the two <hi>Zy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomatick,</hi> or the two Bones of the Cheek-Knots; the two <hi>Lachrymal</hi> in the great Corners of the Eyes toward the Noſe; the two <hi>Maxillar,</hi> that receive the Upper-Teeth, and which form part of the Palate of the Mouth, and the Orbits of the Eyes; the two Bones of the Noſe; the two Palate-Bones which are at its end, and behind the Noſtrils; the laſt being ſingle is the <hi>Vomer,</hi> which makes the Diviſion of the lower part of the Noſtrils; and there are generally Sixteen Upper-Teeth. The Lower-Jaw contains Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Bones, <hi>viz.</hi> ſixteen Teeth; two Bones that receive them; and the <hi>Os Hyoides,</hi> which is ſingle, and fix'd at the Root of the Tongue.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:39065:15"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>How are the Teeth uſually divided with reſpect to their Qualities?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Into <hi>Inciſive</hi> or Cutters, <hi>Canine</hi> or Dog-Teeth, and <hi>Molar</hi> or Grinders: There are eight Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and four Canine, which have only one ſingle Root; as alſo twenty Molar, every one whereof hath one, two, or three Roots.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Can you recite the Number of the Bones of the Trunk or Cheſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are generally thirty and three in the <hi>Spine</hi> or Chine-Bone of the Back, <hi>viz.</hi> ſeven <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebra's</hi> in the Neck, twelve in the Back, five in the Legs, five, ſix, and ſometimes ſeven in the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> three or four in the <hi>Coccyx,</hi> and two Cartilages at its end.</p>
               <p>There are twenty nine in the Breaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> twenty four Ribs, two Clavicles or Channel-Bones, and commonly three Bones in the <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> The Hip-Bones are likewiſe divided into three, <hi>viz. Ilion, Iſchion,</hi> and <hi>Os Pubis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Do you know the Number of the Bones of the Arms?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are thirty and one Bones in each Arm, that is to ſay, the <hi>Omoplata</hi> or Shoulder-Blade; the <hi>Humerus</hi> or Shoulder-Bone; the two Bones of the Elbow call'd <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna,</hi> and <hi>Radius;</hi> eight little Bones in the <hi>Carpus</hi> or Wriſt; five in the <hi>Metacarpium</hi> or Back of the Hand; and fourteen in the Fingers, three to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one except the Thumb, which hath only two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Can you give us a Liſt of the Bones of the Leg in their Order?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are thirty Bones in each Leg, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Femur</hi> or great Thigh-Bone, the Knee-Pan or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:39065:15"/>Whirl-Bone on the top of the Knee; the <hi>Tibia, greater Focile,</hi> or Shin-Bone; and the <hi>Perone</hi> or <hi>Fibula,</hi> or <hi>leſſer Focile,</hi> which are the two aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated Bones of the Leg; ſeven little Bones in the <hi>Tarſus;</hi> five in the <hi>Metatarſus;</hi> and fourteen in the Toes; that is to ſay, three to every one, except the great Toe, which hath only two.</p>
               <p>Thus the Number of Bones of the Humane <hi>Skeleton</hi> amounts to two hundred and Fifty, without reckoning the <hi>Seſamoides,</hi> the Indent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Skull, and ſome others which are not always to be found.</p>

               <p>There are two different kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts</hi> and the <hi>Congenerate;</hi> the former are thoſe that produce oppoſite Motions; as a <hi>Flexor</hi> and an <hi>Extenſor,</hi> a <hi>Depreſſor</hi> and a <hi>Leva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> The Congenerate are thoſe that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to one and the ſame Action; as when there are two Flexors or two Extenſors, and then one ſupplies the defect of the other; whereas when one of the Antagoniſt Muſcles is cut, the other becomes uſeleſs, and void of Action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is the Action of a Muſole perform'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is done by Contraction and Extenſion; the former cauſeth the Anargoniſt to ſwell, and the other compels it to ſtretch forth in length.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is</hi> Aponeuroſis?</p>
               <p>It is the continuity of the Fibres of a Tendon which makes a Connexion that ſerves to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Muſcle in its Motion.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP VII.</hi> Of the Myology, or Anatomy of the Muſcles of the Head.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>HOW many Muſcles are there appointed to move the Head, and which be they?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Head is mov'd by the means of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Muſcles, ſeven on each ſide; of theſe, two ſerve to depreſs it, eight to lift it up, and four to turn it round about.</p>
               <p>The two Depreſſors are call'd <hi>Sternoclinoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoidei;</hi> they take their Riſe in the <hi>Sternum,</hi> at the Clavicles, and proceed obliquely to join the <hi>Apophyſis Maſtoides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the four Elevators on each, ſide the firſt is the <hi>Splenius,</hi> which begins at the five <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back and the three lower ones of the Neck, and aſcending obliquely, cleaves to the hinder part of the Head. The ſecond, named <hi>Complexus</hi> or <hi>Trigeminus,</hi> having its beginning as the <hi>Splenius',</hi> ſticks in like manner to the hinder part of the Head, and they form together a figure reſembling that of <hi>S. Andrew</hi>'s Croſs. The third is the <hi>Rectus Major,</hi> which proceeding from the ſecond <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck, ſhoots forward to join the hinder part of the Head. The fourth is the <hi>Rectus Minor,</hi> which begins at the firſt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck, and ends likewiſe in the hinder part of the Head.</p>
               <p>The two Muſcles on each ſide, which move the Head circularly, are the <hi>Obliquus Major</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:39065:17"/>
                  <hi>Minor;</hi> the <hi>greater Oblique</hi> taking its riſe from the ſecond <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck, goes to meet the firſt; but the <hi>leſſer Oblique</hi> hath its Origine in the hinder part of the Head, and proceeds to join the other obliquely in the firſt <hi>Vertebra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How many Muſcles are there in the Lower-Jaw, and which be they?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lower-Jaw hath twelve Muſcles which cauſe it to move; that is to ſay, ſix on each ſide, whereof four ſerve to cloſe and two to open it.</p>
               <p>The firſt of the Openers is the <hi>Latus</hi> which beginning at the top of the <hi>Sternum,</hi> Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicle, and <hi>Acromion,</hi> cleaves on the outſide to the bottom of the Lower-Jaw-Bone. The ſecond of the Openers is the <hi>Digaſtricus,</hi> which takes its riſe in a Fiſſure lying between the Occipital-Bone and the <hi>Apophyſis Maſtoides,</hi> from whence it paſſeth to the bottom of the Chin on the inſide.</p>
               <p>The firſt of the Shutters is the <hi>Crotaphites</hi> or Temporal Muſcle, which hath its Origine at the bottom, and on the ſide of the <hi>Os Coronale,</hi> the <hi>Os Parietale,</hi> and the <hi>Os Petroſum,</hi> from whence it is extended till it cleaves to the <hi>Apophyſis Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noides</hi> of the Lower-Jaw, after having paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Apophyſis</hi> of the <hi>Zygoma:</hi> Its Fibres are ſpread from the Circumference to the Center and it is covered again with the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> which renders its Wounds very dangerous; ſo that the leaſt Inciſions as can be, ought to be made therein.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the <hi>Pterygoideus</hi> or <hi>Aliformis Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternus,</hi> whoſe riſe is in the <hi>Apophyſis Pterygoides,</hi> from whence it ſets forward till it ſtick between the <hi>Condylus</hi> and the Coronal of the Lower-Jaw.</p>
               <p>The third is the <hi>Maſſeter,</hi> which hath two
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39065:17"/>Sources or Beginnings, and as many Inſertions; the firſt Source thereof is at the Cheek-Knot or Ball of the Cheek, and the ſecond at the lower part of the <hi>Zygoma.</hi> The firſt Inſertion is at the outer Corner of the Jaw, and the ſecond in the middle part, by that means forming the Figure of the Letter X.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the <hi>Pterygoideus</hi> or <hi>Aliformis Intern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> which hath its beginning in the <hi>Apophyſis Pte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rygoides,</hi> and is terminated in the inner Corner of the Jaw; ſo that Maſtication or Chewing is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the means of theſe four Muſcles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How many Muſcles are there in the Face, and which be they?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two for the Forehead, call'd <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> whoſe Origine is in the upper part of the Head, from whence they deſcend by ſtreight Fibres, until they are faſten'd in the Skin of the Forehead near the Eye-Brows, where they are re-united: Their Action or Office is to draw the Skin of the Forehead upward, whereto they ſtick very cloſe.</p>
               <p>There are alſo two others call'd <hi>Occipital,</hi> which have their Beginning in the ſame place with the preceeding, but they deſcend backward, and cleave to the Skin of the hinder part of the Head, which they draw upward.</p>
               <p>There are two Muſcles to each Eye-Lid, one whereof is termed the <hi>Attoll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns</hi> or <hi>Elevator</hi> and the other the <hi>Depreſſor.</hi> The Elevator takes its riſe in the bottom of the Orbit of the Eye, and is faſtned by a large <hi>Aponeuroſis</hi> to the edge of the upper Eye-Lid. The Shutter or Depreſſor, call'd alſo the <hi>Orbicular,</hi> hath its Origine in the great <hi>Canthus,</hi> or Corner of the Eye, paſſeth over the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:39065:18"/>Eye-Lid upward, and is join'd to the leſſer Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the ſame Eye, being extended along its whole Compaſs.</p>
               <p>The Eyes have each ſix Muſcles, <hi>viz.</hi> four <hi>Recti</hi> and two <hi>Obliqui;</hi> the <hi>Recti,</hi> or ſtreight Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles are the <hi>Elevator,</hi> the <hi>Depreſſor,</hi> the <hi>Adductor,</hi> and the <hi>Abductor.</hi> The firſt of theſe call'd <hi>Elevator,</hi> or <hi>Superbus,</hi> draws the Eye upward, as it is pull'd downward by the <hi>Depreſſor</hi> or <hi>Humilis;</hi> the <hi>Adductor</hi> or <hi>Bibitorius</hi> draws it toward the Noſe, and the <hi>Abductor</hi> or <hi>Indignarorius</hi> toward the Shoulder: All theſe ſmall Muſcles have their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals and Inſertions in the bottom of the Orbit through which the Optick Nerve paſſeth, and are terminated in the Corneous Tunicle, by a very large <hi>Tendon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of the Oblique ones is term'd the <hi>Obliquus Major,</hi> and the other <hi>Obliquus Minor,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they draw the Eye obliquely. Theſe Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles cauſe Children to ſquint when they do not act together. The <hi>Obliquus Minor</hi> is faſten'd to the outward part of the Orbit near the great Corner, and draws the Eye obliquely toward the Noſe: But the <hi>Obliquus Major</hi> is fixt in the inner part of the Orbit, and aſcends along the Bone to the upper part of the great Corner, where its Tendon paſſeth thro' a ſmall Cartilage nam'd <hi>Trochlea,</hi> and is inſerted in the little Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with the leſſer <hi>Obliquus Minor,</hi> to draw the Eye obliquely toward the leſſer Corner.</p>
               <p>The Ear, altho' not uſually endu'd with any ſenſible Motion, nevertheleſs hath four Muſcles, <hi>viz.</hi> one above, and three behind; the firſt being ſituated over the Temporal, and faſten'd to the Ear to draw it upward: The three others have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:39065:18"/>their beginning in the <hi>Mammillary Apophyſis,</hi> and are terminated in the Root of the Ear, to draw it backward.</p>
               <p>There are alſo three Muſcles in the inner part of the Ear, whereof the external belonging to the <hi>Malleus</hi> or Hammer lies under the exterior part of the Bony Paſſage which reacheth from the Ear to the Palate of the Mouth, being fixt in a very oblique Sinuoſity which is made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately above the Bone that bears the Furrow, into which is let the Skin of the <hi>Tympanum</hi> or Drum. The internal Muſcle lies hid in a Bony Semi-Canal, in the <hi>Os Petroſum;</hi> one part of which Semi-Canal is without the Drum, and clos'd on the top with a Paſſage that leads from the Ear into the Palate. But the other part within the Drum advanceth to the <hi>Feneſtra Ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> and is inſerted in the hinder part of the Handle of the <hi>Malleus.</hi> The Muſcle of the <hi>Stapes</hi> or Stirrup is alſo hid in a Bony Tube, almoſt at the bottom of the Drum, and fixt in the Head of the <hi>Stapes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Noſe hath ſeven Muſcles, that is to ſay, one common and ſix proper; the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes part of the orbicular Muſcle of the Lips, and draws the Noſe downward with the Lip. Of the ſix proper Muſcles of the Noſe, four ſerve to dilate it, being ſituated on the outſide, and two to contract it, which are placed in the inſide.</p>
               <p>The two firſt Dilatators of a Pyramidal Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, take their riſe in the Suture of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and are faſten'd by a large Filament to the <hi>Alae</hi> of the Noſe. The two other Dilatators reſembling a Myrtle-Leaf have their Source in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:39065:19"/>the Bone of the Noſe, and are inſerted in the middle of the <hi>Ala.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two Reſtrictors are Membranous, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the internal part of the Bone of the Noſe and adhering to the inner <hi>Ala</hi> of the Noſtril.</p>
               <p>The Lips have thirteen Muſcles, <hi>viz.</hi> eight pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per, and five common: Of the proper there ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>HOW many Muſcles are there in the Breaſt, and which be they?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Breaſt hath fifty ſeven Muſcles, that is to ſay, thirty that ſerve to dilate it, twenty ſix whoſe Office is to contract it, and the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> or Midriff, which partakes of both Actions.</p>
               <p>The thirty which dilate the Breaſt are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plac'd to the number of Fifteen, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Subelavius,</hi> the <hi>Serratus Major Anticus,</hi> the two <hi>Serrati Poſtici,</hi> and the eleven external <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtals.</hi>

               <p>The twenty ſix which contract the Breaſt are likewiſe equally rank'd to the Number of thirteen on each ſide, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Triangula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> the <hi>Sacrolumbus,</hi> and eleven internal <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Subclavian</hi> takes up the whole ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Clavicle and the firſt Rib: Its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal being in the internal and lower part of the <hi>Clavicula,</hi> and its inſertion in the upper part of the firſt Rib.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Serratus Major</hi> is a large Muſcle having ſeven or eight Indentings or Jaggs. It takes its riſe in the interior Baſis of the <hi>Omoplata</hi> or Shoulder-Blade, and its Jaggings are inſerted in

               <p>The eleven <hi>External Intercoſtal</hi> Muſcles are ſituated in the ſpaces between the twelve Ribs paſſing obliquely and on the outſide from the bad part to the fore part. They take their riſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Upper Rib, and have their Inſertion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the lower Rib.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Triangularis</hi> is the firſt of thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Breaſt, and poſſeſſeth the inward part of the <hi>Sternum:</hi> Its Original is in its lower part and its Inſertion in the top of the Cartilages of the two upper Ribs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sacrolumbus</hi> hath its Source in the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> as alſo in the <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra's</hi> of the Loins, and aſcending from thence, inſinuates it ſelf into the hinder part of the Ribs to every one of which it imparts two <hi>Tendons</hi> one whereof ſticks on the outſide, and the other on the inſide. This Muſcle is fleſhy within, and fibrous without.</p>
               <p>The Eleven <hi>Internal Intercoſtals,</hi> contrary to the External, derive their Original from the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:39065:22"/>top of every lower Rib, and aſcend obliquely from the back-part to the fore-part, till they are join'd to the lower Lip of every upper Rib: Thus theſe Internal Muſcles, with the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, form, by the oppoſition of their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, a Figure reſembling a <hi>Burgundian</hi> Croſs.</p>
               <p>The Diaphragm or Midriff is eſteem'd as the fifty ſeventh Muſcle of the Breaſt, and ſerves as well for its dilatation as contraction. It ſeparates the <hi>Thorax</hi> or Cheſt from the lower Belly, and is tied circularly to all the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Baſtard Ribs, immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Xiphoides,</hi> or Sword-like Cartilage.</p>
               <p>Modern Anatomiſts have diſcover'd that the Diaphragm is compos'd of two Muſcles, <hi>viz.</hi> one Upper, and the other Lower; ſo that the Upper cleaves to the Extremities of the Spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ribs, and is terminated in a flat <hi>Tendon</hi> in the middle, which hath been always taken for its Nervous part. The Lower begins with two Productions, the longeſt whereof being on the right ſide, ariſeth from the three upper <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebra's</hi> of the Loins, and the other on the Left from the two <hi>Vertebra's</hi> of the Back, till it is loſt in the <hi>Aponeuroſis</hi> of the Upper Muſcle.</p>

                  <hi>How many Muſcles are there in the Back and the Loins, and which be they?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three in each ſide, <hi>viz.</hi> one for Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the other for Extenſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Triangularis</hi> is the <hi>Flexor,</hi> taking its riſe in the hinder part of the Rib of the <hi>Os Ilion,</hi> and the inner part of the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> in paſſing from whence it is joined to the laſt of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:39065:23"/>Ribs, and to the tranſverſe Productions of the <hi>Vertebra's</hi> of the Loins.</p>

               <p>The Nerves are round white Bodies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd in a double Membrane, communicated to them from the two <hi>Meninges</hi> of the Brain: Their Office is to convey the Animal Spirits into all the Parts.</p>

               <p>All the Nerves take their Original from the <hi>Medulla Oblongata,</hi> and that of the Spine.</p>

                  <hi>WHAT is the Head?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a bony Part, that contains and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſeth the Brain within its Cavity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is moſt remarkable in the outward parts of the Head?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Temporal Arteries, the <hi>Crotaphitae,</hi> of Temporal Muſcles, and the Sutures of the Skull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why are theſe things conſiderable?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Temporal Arteries are of good Note becauſe they are expos'd on the outſide, lying even with the Skin. The <hi>Crotophite</hi> Muſcles are ſo likewiſe, in regard that they cannot be hurt without danger of Convulſions, by reaſon of the <hi>Pericranium</hi> with which they are cover'd. And the Sutures, becauſe the <hi>Meninges</hi> of the Brain proceed from thence to form the <hi>Pericranium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the</hi> Pericranium?</p>
               <p>It is a Membrane that lies under the thick hairy Skin of the Head, and immediately covers the Skull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the</hi> Meninges?</p>
               <p>They are two Membranes that encloſe the Subſtance or Marrow of the Brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Suture?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:39065:46"/>
               <p>It is a kind of thick Seam or Stitch, that ſerves to unite the Bones of the Skull.</p>

                  <hi>How many ſorts of Sutures are there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> the true, and the falſe or Baſtard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the true Sutures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are three in number, namely the <hi>Sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> the <hi>Coronal,</hi> and the <hi>Lambdoidal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the diſpoſition or ſituation of the true Sutures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Sagittal</hi> is ſtreight, beginning in the middle of the Fore-head, and ſometimes at the root of the Noſe, and being terminated behind, at the joining of the two Branches of the <hi>Lambdoidal Suture?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Coronal appears in form of a Crown, paſſing to the middle of the Head, and deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thro' the Temples, to finiſh its Circumference in the Root of the Noſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lambdoidal</hi> Suture is made like an open Pair of Compaſſes, the Legs whereof are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended toward the Shoulders; and the Button is in the top of the Head backward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the Baſtard Sutures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are thoſe that are call'd <hi>Squamous</hi> or ſcaly, <hi>What is the diſpoſition or natural ſituation of theſe falſe Sutures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are plac'd at the two ſides of the Head, and make a Semi-Circle of the bigneſs of the Ears, round the ſame Ears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What difference is there between the true and ſpurious Sutures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The true Sutures are made in form of the Teeth of a Saw, which enter one into the other; and the falſe or Baſtard ones are thoſe that reſemble the Scales of Fiſhes, which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:39065:47"/>are join'd together by paſſing one over the other.</p>

                  <hi>What is the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Sutures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ancients were of Opinion, that they were made to hinder the Fracture of one Skull-Bone from paſſing thro' the whole Head; but there is more reaſon to believe that they have the three following Uſes, that is to ſay,

                  </list> As for the time of its Formation, it is four-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> the Beginning, Increaſe, State, and Declination, wherein altogether different Remedies are to be apply'd.

               </p>
               <p>Yes, but it is done imperfectly, in regard that a Tumour or Impoſtume cannot be ſaid to be abſolutely cur'd, as long as there remains any thing of the Original Malady, as it happens in the <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> where the Matter is harden'd by an imperfect diſſolving of it, or when the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume degenerates into a greater and more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Diſtemper, as it appears in the <hi>Eſthiome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> or Gangrene that ſucceeds it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>No, it is ſometimes neceſſary to open 'em with a Crucial Inciſion, when they are large, or when a <hi>Cyſtis</hi> or Membranous Vehicle is to be extirpated.</p>

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>There are three. <hi>viz.</hi> the Primitive, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, and the Conjunct: The Primitive is that which gives occ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſion to the Tumours; as for Example, a Fall or a Blow receiv'd. The Antecedent is that which ſupplies it with Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſuch is the Maſs of Blood that thickens and maintains the <hi>Phlegmon.</hi> Laſtly, the Conjunct Cauſe is the overflowing Blood or Matter, which immediately forms the Tumor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What regard ought to be had to theſe three ſorts of Cauſes in the Cure?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Primitives Cauſe may be prevented by avoiding the Falls, Blows, or other Hurts, and the Antecedent by diminiſhing the Plethory of the Blood, and cooling the whole Maſs by Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy. The Conjunct Cauſe, which is the overflowing of the Blood, may be alſo remov'd in diſperſing it by diſſolving, or elſe in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging it by Suppuration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a</hi> Criſis?</p>
               <p>It is a ſudden ſetling of Humors, which happens in Diſeaſes, whereby they are uſually terminated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How are theſe Critical Setlings effected?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Strength of Nature, which either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels the peccant Humours thro' the Belly, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them to the Habitude of the Body; for in the former ſhe cauſeth Fluxes of Humours, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine and Blood; as in the other ſhe excites Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Tumours, and even a Gangrene it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In what Parts do the Critical Tumours uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ariſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:39065:58"/>
               <p>In the Glandules, which the Ancients call'd the <hi>Emunctories</hi> of the Brain, Heart, and Liver; for they gave the Name of Emunctories of the Brain to the thick Glandules which lie under the Ears, that of the Emunctories of the Hean to thoſe that are under the Arm-Pits; and that of the Emunctories of the Liver to thoſe under the Groin.

                     <p>When it is little, as that which happens after an Operation of Phlebotomy or letting Blood ill perform'd, it may be ſufficient to lay upon the affected Part a thin Plate of Lead, or elſe a Piece of Money or Counter wrapt up in a Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and to bind it on very ſtreight: But a Piece of Paper chew'd is much better for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Anueriſm</hi> be conſiderable, an Aſtringent Plaiſter may be us'd, ſuch as the following.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Bolus,</hi> Dragon's Blood, Frankincence, Aloes, and <hi>Hypocyſtis,</hi> of each a Dram; mingle the whole with two beaten Eggs, and add Wax to give it the conſiſtence of a Plaiſter, which may be apply'd alone, or mixt with an equal Portion of <hi>Emplaſtrum contra Rupturam,</hi> always making a ſmall Bandage to keep it on. <hi>Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum de Cicuta</hi> hath alſo a wonderful effect.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Varices</hi> are not generally dangerous, but even conduce to the preſervation of Health; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, if they become troubleſome by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their greatneſs, and the Pains that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie'em, they may be mollify'd with the following Remedy.</p>
                     <p>Take the Mucilages of the Seeds of <hi>Pſyllium</hi> and Line, of each two Ounces; of <hi>Populeon</hi>

                     <p>If the Blood abound too much, it may be diſcharg'd by the Application of Leeches, or by a Puncture made with a Lancet: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward lay upon the Part a Piece of Lead ſow'd up in a Cloth, and let it be kept cloſe with a proper Bandage. Otherwiſe you may make uſe of an Aſtringent, ſuch as this.</p>
                     <p>Take a Pomegranate, cut it in pieces, and boil it with as much Salt as may be taken up with the Tip of your Fingers, in a Gallon of ſtrong Vinegar; then dip a Spunge in this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, apply it to the <hi>Varix,</hi> bind it on, and continue the uſe of it twice a Day for a Month together.</p>

                     <p>Take an Ounce of good Vinegar, ſteeping therein a Dram of White Vitriol, with as much <hi>Sal Ammoniack:</hi> Let it be us'd in bathing the Part; and apply thereto Bolſters well ſeak'd in the ſame Liquor.

                     <p>But a Tincture of Myrrh and Aloes is more efficacious, wherein <hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>What is the Dropſy call'd</hi> Leucophlegmatia?</p>
                     <p>It is a Tumour, or, to ſpeak more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; a general Swelling or Bloating of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parts of the Body, as well as of the lower Belly. It is produc'd by a viſcous and mucilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſort of Phlegm; whence it happens that the Print of the Fingers remains in thoſe places that have been preſs'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What are the particular kinds of Dropſies?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are thoſe that are incident to different Parts, of which they bear the Names; as the <hi>Hydrocephalus,</hi> which is the Dropſy of the Head; the <hi>Exomphalus,</hi> of the Navel, and the <hi>Hydre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cele</hi> of the <hi>Scrotum.</hi> There is alſo a Dropſy of the Breaſt, and that of the <hi>Matrix.</hi>

                     <p>A Decoction of the Roots of Briony with Cinnamon and Liquoriſh, provokes Urine very much; as well as a Decoction of Turneps and Carrets, and an Infuſion of Sage in White-Wine.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>WHat is a</hi> Scirrhus?</p>
                  <p>It is a hard unmoveable Tumour, almoſt altogether void of Pain, and of a livid dark Colour; which is form'd of a Melancholick Humour, frequently ſucceeding <hi>Phlegmons</hi> and <hi>Oedema's</hi> that have not been well dreſs'd with convenient Remedies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How is a</hi> Scirrhus <hi>cur'd?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By mollifying or diſſolving it, and ſeldom by bringing it to Suppuration.</p>
                  <p>It may be mollify'd by the application of a Cataplaſm or Pultis, compos'd of the Leaves of Violet-Plants, Mallows, Beets, Elder, Rue, and Wormwood, with Camomile-Flowers,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:39065:68"/>Horſe-Dung, Cow-Dung, and White Lillies. The whole Maſs is to be boil'd together in Wine, afterward adding Honey and Hogs-Lard, to make a Cataplaſm thereof with the Crum of White Bread.</p>
                  <p>It is diſſolv'd with Plaiſters compos'd of thoſe of <hi>Diachylon,</hi> Melilot, and Mucilages, to which is added <hi>Oleum Lumbricorum,</hi> and Flower of Brimſtone. To render the Remedy more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, Oil of Tobacco may be alſo mixt with it, and Gum <hi>Ammoniack</hi> diſſolv'd in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, theſe Topical or outward Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are to be accompany'd with others ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken inwardly, which ſerve to prepare the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours for convenient Evacuations; Such are Crab's-Eyes, the Decoctions of <hi>Sarſaparilla,</hi> the uſe of good Wine, and light Meats of eaſie Digeſtion.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Polypus</hi> may be cur'd in the beginning, but it is to be fear'd leſt it degenerate into an incurable Cancer, when it hath been neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected or ill dreſs'd.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the general Remedies, which are let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Blood a little, and reiterated Purgations, with an exact Regulation of Diet, there are alſo particular Medicaments which dry up and inſenſibly conſume the Excreſcence; as a Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Patient muſt ſometimes likewiſe keep in his Mouth a Sage-Leaf, ſometimes a piece of the Root of Pellitory of <hi>Spain;</hi> and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time Tobacco or ſome other thing of this Nature, which cauſeth Salivation. If the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour continues too long, and doth not yield to the above-mention'd Remedies, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſary to proceed to a Manual Operation,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:39065:69"/>which is very often perform'd with good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Natta's,</hi> it is moſt expedient not to meddle with 'em at all; nevertheleſs theſe Marks which Infants bring along with 'em into the World, are frequently defac'd by an Application of the After-Burdens, whilſt they are as yet warm, aſſoon as their Mothers are deliver'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What is a Cancer?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a hard, painful, and ulcerous Tumour, produc'd by an aduſt Humour, the Malignity whereof can ſcarce be ſuppreſs'd by any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>How many ſorts of Cancers are there?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> The Primitive and the Degenerate; the Primitive Cancer is that which comes of it ſelf, and appears at firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bigneſs of a Pea or Bean, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs doth not ceaſe to cauſe an inward Pain, continual, and pricking by intervals; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this time it is call'd an Occult Cancer; but when grown bigger, and open'd, it bears the Name of an Ulcerated Cancer; which is ſo much the leſs capable of being cur'd or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwag'd, as it makes it ſelf more conſpicuous by its dreadful Symptoms, or concomitant Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
                     <p>The Degenerate Cancer is that which ſucceeds an obſtinate and ill-dreſs'd Tumour or Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume, and which becomes an Ulcerated Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, without aſſuming the Nature of a blind or occult one.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What Remedies are requiſite to be apply'd to a blind Cancer?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:39065:69"/>
                     <p>In regard that it cannot be known in this Condition without difficulty, it is often neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nevertheleſs it is a Matter of great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prevent its Conſequences, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by a good Diet, and by general Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which may gently rectifie the intempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Bowels: Afterwards Baths may be preſcrib'd, together with the uſe of Whey Aſſes-Milk, and Specificks in general, as Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Crab's-Eyes, Vipers, Adders, and others. As for Topical Remedies, none are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter'd, except it be judg'd convenient to apply to the Tumour a Piece of Lead rubb'd with Quick-ſilver; all others ſerving only to make the Skin tender, and apt to break. The Patient may alſo take for his Drink Water of <hi>Scorzonera</hi> and Hart's-Horn, with the Flowers of Bugloſs or Borage, and Liquorice: Or elſe Quick-ſilver-Water alone, boiling an Ounce of it in a Quart of Water every time, the Quick-ſilver always remaining at the bottom of the Veſſel.</p>

                        <hi>What are the Remedies for an ulcerated Cancer?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides the general ones, that are the ſame with thoſe of the blind Cancer, there are alſo Topical, which may take place here. The Powders of Toads, Moles, Frogs, and Crabs calcin'd, cleanſe the Ulcers perfectly well. A Decoction of Vipers and Crabs may ſerve to bath 'em, and ſome of it may be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. Deterſives made of Lime-Water, or Whey clarify'd, and boil'd with Chervil are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good; and (if you pleaſe) you may add Camphire or <hi>Saccharum Saturni.</hi>

                     <p>If the Pains grow violent, recourſe is to be had to <hi>Laudanum,</hi> one or two Grains whereof may be given in a little Conſerve of Roſes. When the Cancer is ſituated in the Glandules or Fleſh, the Extirpation of it may alſo be undertaken with good Succeſs.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>What are the kinds of theſe Tumours?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are the <hi>Steatoma,</hi> the <hi>Atheroma,</hi> the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liceris,</hi> the Wen, the <hi>Bronchocele,</hi> and the <hi>Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phula</hi> or King's-Evil.</p>

                  <hi>How is the difference between theſe Tumours diſcern'd?</hi>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:39065:70"/>equally retains in all three the print of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that preſs it. But the <hi>Bronchocele</hi> is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by the Place and Part which it poſſeſſeth; that is to ſay, the Throat; as alſo by its ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hard conſiſtence without the Alteration of the Skin. The <hi>Scrophulae</hi> or King's-Evil Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are known by their unequal Hardneſs, and their ſituation in the Glandules, either in the Neck, Arm-pits or elſewhere, without alteration likewiſe of the Skin.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>An Attempt is to be made to diſſolve 'em, as in all the others; nevertheleſs the ſafeſt way is to bring 'em to Suppuration, and to extirpate the <hi>Cyſtes,</hi> which are apt to be ſill'd again after the Diſſipation of the Humour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What are the Medicines proper to diſſolve theſe Tumours?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are all ſuch as may be us'd for the <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dema</hi> and <hi>Scirrhus;</hi> but the Specificks or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Remedies are theſe:</p>
                  <p>Take Roſemary, Sage, Wormwood, Elder, great Celandine, Camomile, Melilot, St. <hi>John</hi>'s. Wort, and Tobacco; boil 'em in White-Wine with Soot and Mercurial Honey, adding, thereto Cummin-ſeeds beaten, and <hi>Olcum Lumbricorum,</hi> to make a Cataplaſm, which is to be renew'd twice a Day. Afterward if the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour be not diſpers'd, you may apply the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Plaiſter, which hath an admirable Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:39065:71"/>
                  <p>Take an equal Portion of the Plaiſter of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chylon, Devigo,</hi> and four times as much <hi>Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Emplaſtrum Divinum;</hi> let 'em be diſſolv'd together; then intermix Saffron, and Oil of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, to make a Plaiſter with the whole Maſs, which may be ſpread upon thin Leather, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the Tumour, without taking it off on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly once every eighth Day, to cool it; ſo that it muſt be laid on again after having waſh'd and bath'd the Part with warm Urine or Brine.</p>
                  <p>But it is to be always remember'd that exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Remedies take effect only imperfectly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are aſſiſted by internal, ſuch as in this caſe are reirerated Purgations, join'd with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Diet.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe thoſe may be us'd that ſerve in other kinds of Tumours: But as for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of the <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> it is done by dividing the Tumour into four Parts, by procuring Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and by conſuming the Bag by little and little. The <hi>Bronchocele</hi> alone will not admit this Extirpation, by reaſon of the great Number of Nerves, Veins, and neighbouring Arteries amidſt which the Tumour is ſettl'd. However <hi>Bron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chotomy,</hi> or opening the Throat, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; which is an Operation peculiar to this Tumour.</p>

               <p>Malignant Impoſtumes or Tumours are thoſe that are obſtinate, and do not eaſily yield to the moſt efficacious Remedies.</p>
               <p>Peſtilential Impoſtumes or Tumours are thoſe that are accompany'd with a Fever, Swooning, Head-ach, and Faintneſs: They uſually ariſe in the time of a Plague or Peſtilence, and are contagious.</p>
               <p>Venereal Tumours or Impoſtumes are thoſe that appear only at the bottom of the Groin, and are the product of an impure <hi>Coitus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, the Critical Impoſtume may be Malignant, Peſtilential, and Venereal; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Impoſtume may be neither Critical, nor Peſtilential, nor Venereal: But the Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and Venereal Tumours are always Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Scurvy.</head>
               <p>THIS Diſeaſe is known by the Ulcers of the Mouth, which are very ſtinking; as alſo by exceſſive Salivation, great Pains in the Head, Dizzineſs, frequent Epilepſies, Apoplexies, and Palſies. The Face, being of a pale red, and dark Colour, is ſometimes puff'd up or bloated, inflam'd, and beſet with Puſtules: The Teeth are looſe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ake, the Gums are ſwell'd, itch, putrifie, exulcerate, and are eaten with the Canker; and the Jaw is almoſt unmoveable: The Members are bow'd, and cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: The Patients become ſtupid and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſo that they fetch their Breath with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, are obnoxious to Palpitations of the Heart and Coughs, and fall into Swoons: The Ulcers ſometimes are ſo malignant, that their Cheeks are entirely eaten up, and their Teeth ſeen: They are alſo much inclin'd to Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Looſeneſs, and Gripes; and their Entrails are ſwell'd: They have red and livid Puſtules on their Belly and Privy-parts, which ſometimes break out into Ulcers; their whole Body being dry'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe may be eaſily cur'd in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but when it is grown inveterate, and invades the Bowels, it becomes incurable; as well as when it is the Epidemical Diſeaſe of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:39065:73"/>the Country, or the Perſons afflicted with it, are old, or well advanc'd in Years.</p>
               <p>In undertaking the Cure, it is requiſite to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with a good Diet, and to ſweeten the Blood, let the Patient take the Broth of boil'd Fowl; eating Pullets and Eggs; in the Broth may alſo be put divers ſorts of Antiſcorbutick Herbs; <hi>viz.</hi> Creſſes, Spinage, Parſly-Roots, Sparagus, Smallage, <hi>Scorzonera,</hi> Scurvy-Graſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let him eat nothing that is high ſeaſon'd, nor acid or ſharp; let him drink pure Claret, without any adulterate Mixture; let him uſe moderate Exerciſe and Reſt; Laſtly, let him keep his Mind ſedate, and free from all manner of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Paſſion.</p>
               <p>The following Remedies taken inwardly are very good for the Scurvy, <hi>viz.</hi> the Tincture of Flints from ten Grains to thirty; Diaphoretick Antimony, from ſix Grains to thirty; ſweet Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate, from ſix Grains to thirty; <hi>Mars Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreteus,</hi> from ten Grains to twenty; <hi>Crocus Martis Aperitivus,</hi> from ten Grains to two Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; prepar'd Coral, from ten Grains to one Dram; Volatile Spirit of <hi>Sal Ammoniack,</hi> from ſix Drops to twenty; Water of Creſſes, from fifteen Drops to one Dram; Spirit of Scurvy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs, from ten Drops to one Dram; Tincture of Antimony, from four Drops to twenty; Oily Volatile <hi>Sal Ammoniack,</hi> from four Grains to fifteen; Spirit of <hi>Guyacum,</hi> from half a Dram to a Dram and a half; Vitrioliz'd <hi>Tartar,</hi> from ten Grains to thirty; the Volatile Salt of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> Urine, Vipers, and Hart's-Horn, of each from ſix Grains to fifteen; the Spirit of Gum <hi>Ammoniack,</hi> from eight Drops to ſixteen; White
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:39065:73"/>
                  <hi>Mercury</hi> Precipitate, from four to ten Grains; <hi>Mercurial Panacaea,</hi> from ſix Grains to two Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. We ſhall ſhew the manner of compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em in our Treatiſe of Venereal Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>It is alſo expedient to give Emollient and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſive Clyſters to the Patient at Night going to bed, his Body being always kept open with convenient Diet-drinks: Afterward let him take gentle Sudorificks, ſuch as are made of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions of Fumitory, wild Cicory, Dandelion, Hart's-Tongue, Scabious, the leſſer Houſe-Leek, Germander, Borage, <hi>Scorzonera</hi>-Root, and Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pody, with Flowers of Broom, Elder, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gold.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſtronger for cold Conſtitutions, <hi>viz.</hi> Decoctions of Scurvy-Graſs, <hi>Lepidium,</hi> Arſe-ſmart, the leſſer Celandine, Wormwood, little Houſe-Leek, <hi>Trifolium Febrinum,</hi> Angelico, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper-Berries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Convenient Decoctions to waſh the Mouth may be made with Sage, Roſemary, Hyſſop, Oak-Leaves, Scurvy-Graſs, Creſſes, Tobacco, Roots of Biſtort, <hi>Ariſtolochy</hi> or Birth-Wort, Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, Flower-de-Luce, <hi>Balauſtia</hi> or Pomegranate-Flowers, Red Roſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To corroborate the Gums, Gargariſms are made of Anti-Scorbutick Plants; as of Spirit of Scurvy-Graſs two Drams, one Scruple of Spirit of Vitriol, one Scruple of common Salt, four Ounces of Roſe-Water and Plantane-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But if the Gums are putrefy'd, they are to be rubb'd with Honey of Roſes, and ſome Drops of Spirit of Salt.</p>
               <p>To aſſwage the Pains of the Members, Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Fomentations are to be us'd; and a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:39065:74"/>Decoction of Saxifrage taken inwardly, with ſome Grains of <hi>Laudanum</hi> is good for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>To allay the Gripes, Clyſters may be given with Whey, Sugar, Yolks of Eggs, Syrrop of Poppies, and Oils of Earth-Worms, Scurvy-Graſs, Camomile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt the Scorbutick Dropſy, take the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Trifolium Febrinum</hi> and Elicampane, from twenty four Drops to thirty, and continue the uſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Milk taken inwardly hinders Vomitting; and a Broth or Gelly of Crabs ſweetens the Blood. The Looſeneſs may be ſtopt with the Eſſence of Wormwood, and Spirit of <hi>Maſtick;</hi> as alſo the Fever with Febrifuges and Anti-ſcorbuticks.</p>
               <p>The Spots may be fomented with Decoctions of Aromatick and Anti-Scorbutick Herbs and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre. For the Ulcers of the Legs, pulverize an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual quantity of <hi>Saccharum Saturni, Crocus Martis,</hi> Myrrh, and <hi>Mercurius Dulcis,</hi> and lay it upon the Bolſters that are to be apply'd to the Sores.</p>
               <p>To mollifie the ſharpneſs of Acid Humours, this is a good Remedy: Prepare half an Ounce of Spirit of Scurvy-Graſs, two Drams of tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd Spirit <hi>Ammoniack,</hi> a Dram of the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Worms. Take thrice a Day fifteen or twenty Drops of this Liquor, in a Decoction of the Tops of Firr.</p>
               <p>Againſt the Tubercles, take two Handfuls of the Flowers of Camomile and Elder, three Drams of Briony-Root, and an Handful of White-Bread Crum; Boil the whole Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Milk, and make Cataplaſms thereof.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:39065:74"/>
               <p>To mitigate the Pains in the Head, take twenty or thirty five Drops of the Tincture of Amber, in Anti-ſcorbutick Spirits or Waters.</p>
               <p>The difficulty of Reſpiration may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd by a Medicinal Compoſition made of two Drams of an Anti-ſcorbutick Water, two Drams of the Eſſence of Elicampane, and half a Dram of the Spirit of Gum <hi>Ammoniack;</hi> take three or four Spoonfuls thereof ſeveral times in a Day.</p>
               <p>To prevent the putrefaction of the Gums, take one Dram of the Tincture of Gum <hi>Lacca,</hi> three Drams of the Spirit of Scurvy-Graſs, with fifteen or twenty Drops of Oil of Tartar made <hi>per De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquium,</hi> and rub the Gums with this Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion many times in a Day. Brandy in which Camphire is infus'd, or Spirit of Wine, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a moſt excellent Remedy; as alſo all Loti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Waſhes made with the Waters or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions of Anti-ſcorbutick Plants.</p>
               <p>For Leanneſs, Goat's-Milk with the Spirit of Scurvy-Graſs may be us'd, and other Waters drawn from Anti-ſcorbutick Plants. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zemes or Decoctions of Endive, Cicory, Sorrel, <hi>Becabunga,</hi> and Snail-Water, are in like manner very good for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Ointment of <hi>Styrax</hi> is frequently us'd in the Hoſpital call'd <hi>Hôtel-Dieu</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and apply'd to Spots and callous Swellings that ariſe in the Legs.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of Sutures.</head>
               <p>SUTURES or Stitches are made only in recent, and as yet bleeding Wounds, when they cannot be re-united by Bandage, as are the tranſverſe; provided there be no Contuſion, nor loſs of Subſtance, nor great Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhages, as alſo that the Wounds were not made by the biting of venomous Beaſts, that there be no violent Inflammations, and that the Bones are not laid open; becauſe generally 'tis neceſſary to cauſe 'em to be exfoliated; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this Operation to be perform'd in the Breaſt, by reaſon of its Motion.</p>
               <p>The Inſtruments proper for the making of Stitches, are ſtreight and crooked Needles,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:39065:75"/>with waxed Thread; and theſe Sutures are of four ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt the <hi>Intermittent Stitch</hi> for tranſverſe Wounds; the ſecond for the Hare-Lip; the third, commonly call'd the <hi>Dry Stitch,</hi> for ſuperficial Wounds; and the fourth, term'd the <hi>Glover's Stitch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Intermittent Stitch is that which is made at certain ſeparated Points, according to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner: After having taken away all extraneous Bodies out of the Wound, let a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant draw together its Sides or Lips; and let a Needle with waxed Thread be paſs'd thro' the middle from the outſide to the inſide, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Points being made proportionably to its length. It is requiſite to pierce a good way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Edge of the Wound, and to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate to the bottom, leſt any Blood ſhou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Space, that might hinder the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniting.</p>
               <p>If the Wound hath Corners, the Surgeon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſow there; and before the Knot is made, cauſeth the Lips of the Wound to be drawn ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly cloſe one to another: The Knots muſt be begun with that in the middle, and a ſingle one is firſt made on the ſide oppoſite to the running of the Matter; laying upon this Knot (if it be thought convenient) a ſmall Bolſter of waxed Linnen, on which is tied a Slip-Knot, to the end that it may be untied if any bad Accident ſhould happen. If a Plaiſter be apply'd to the Wound after the Stitching, a ſmall Bolſter is to be laid over the Knots, to prevent their ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Plaiſter. In caſe any Inflammation happens in the Wound, the Knots may be looſen'd and ty'd again when the Symptoms ceaſe: But
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:39065:76"/>if the Inflammation continue, the Threads are to be cut by paſſing a Probe underneath: When the Wound is clos'd, the Threads are cut in like manner with a Probe; and in drawing 'em out, a Finger muſt be laid near the Knot, leſt the Wound ſhould open again.</p>
               <p>To make the ſecond ſort of Stitch for the Hare-Lip, a ſmall ſtreight Needle is paſs'd into the ſides of the Wound, and the Thread is twiſted round the Needle, by croſſing it above at every Stitch.</p>
               <p>To form the <hi>Dry Stitch</hi> in very ſuperficial Wounds, a piece of new Linnen-Cloth is to be taken, wherein are made Digitations, or many Corners; the Selvedge or Hem ought to be on the ſide of theſe Corners or Digitations; and a ſmall Thread-Lace is ty'd to every one of 'em. Afterward this Cloth is dipt in ſtrong Glue, and apply'd about a Finger's breadth from the Edges of the Wound; ſo that a piece thereof being ſtuck on each ſide, the Laces may be ty'd together, to cauſe the Lips of the Wound to meet.</p>
               <p>To make the <hi>Glover's Stitch,</hi> the Operator having drawn together the Lips of the Wound, holds 'em between two Fingers, paſſeth a Needle underneath 'em, and ſoweth 'em upward all along, after the manner of <hi>Glovers.</hi>

                  <hi>WHAT is a Wound?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Wound is a recent, violent, and bloody Rupture or Solution of the Natural Union of the ſoft Parts, made by a pricking, cutting, or bruiſing Inſtrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ought to be obſerv'd before all things in the curing of Wounds?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is requiſite to take notice of their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as well as of the Inſtruments with which they were made; to the end that Conſequences may be drawn from thence for the Application of proper Remedies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From whence ariſe the differences of Wounds, and which be they?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are taken either from their Figure or Situation: With regard to their Figure, they are call'd Long, Broad or Wide, Triangular Great, Little, Superficial, or Deep; and with reſpect to their Situation, they are term'd Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Complicated, Dangerous, or Mortal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Simple and a Complicated Wound?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Simple Wound is that which only opens the Fleſh, and hath no other concomitant Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; but a Complicated Wound, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is that which is attended with grievous Symptoms, as Haemorrhages, Fractures of Bones, Diſlocation, Lameneſs, and others of the like Nature.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>What is a dangerous and mortal Wound?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A dangerous Wound is that which is complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Accidents whereof are dreadful: As when an Artery is open'd or prick'd, when a Nerve or Tendon is cut, or when the Wound is near a Joynt and accompanied with a Diſlocation or Fracture. A mortal Wound is that which muſt be inevitably follow'd by Death; as is that which is ſituated deep in a principal Part neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Preſervation of Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the Parts wherein Wounds are mortal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are the Brain, the Heart, the Lungs, the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> or Gullet. the Diaphragm, the Liver, the Stomach, the Spleen, the ſmall Guts, the Bladder, the Womb, and generally all the great Veſſels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherein doth the Cure of Wounds conſiſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In helping Nature readily to procure the reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting of the Parts that have been divided, after having taken away or aſſwag'd every thing that might cauſe an Obſtacle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the things that hinder the ſpeedy reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Parts?</hi> They are extraneous Bodies found therein, as Bullets, Flocks, and Pieces of Wood or Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As alſo ſometimes the Accidents which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend 'em; as an <hi>Haemorrhage</hi> or Flux of Blood, Inflammation, <hi>Eſthiomenus</hi> or Mortification, <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſarcoſis,</hi> or an Excreſcence of Fleſh, Diſlocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Fracture of a Bone, the Splinter of a Bone, &amp; ſometimes a contrary Air.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The common Remedy is a kind of Cataplaſm, made up with the Powders of Aloes, Dragons-Blood, Bole Armenick and Whites of Eggs, which are mix'd together and laid upon the Wound. But the following is an excellent one.</p>

                  <p>To this Purpoſe you may alſo make uſe of Cobwebs, Mill-Duſt, and the Powder of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten Oak; or elſe take Oven-Soot mixt with the Juice of the Dung of an Aſs or Ox, adding only thereto the White of an Egg.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe Remedies there are alſo actual and potential Cauteries, or ſimple Ligatures, which are infallible. Indeed the actual Cautery is not always ſure; becauſe when the Eſcar made by the Fire, falls off the Haemorrhage breaks out again as before: but the porential Cautery is almoſt always ſucceſsful; ſuch as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Take about an equal Quantity of Vitriol and Powder of Muſhrooms; apply 'em upon a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Lint to the Place where the Blood iſſueth
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:39065:78"/>forth, and you'll ſee it ſtop immediately: But Care muſt be taken to avoid touching a Nerve or Tendon; by reaſon that the Vitriol is apt to excite Convulſions.</p>

                  <p>If the Inflammation proceeds from the Preſence of an Extraneous Body, it muſt be taken away as ſoon as poſſible with a Pair of Forceps, and if from the Quantity of <hi>Pus</hi> or corrupt Matter, it muſt be let out. But in caſe the Inflammation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth from extreme Pains, they are to be aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Cataplaſms or Pultiſes and anodyn Liniments, ſuch as thoſe that have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>If the Convulſion proceeds from the Biting of ſome venomous Creature, Cupping-Glaſſes or Leeches are to be immediately applied, putting into the Wound Treacle with the Spirit of Wine or even Fire it ſelf, and leaving to the Phyſician's Care the Preſcription of other vulnerary Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies proper to be taken inwardly.</p>

                  <p>Take an Ounce of Treacle, half a Dram of Gum <hi>Ammoniack,</hi> one Dram of <hi>Baellium,</hi> and two Drams of Bore's Greaſe, adding a Quarter of a Pound of Wax to make 'em up into the Form of a.

                     <hi>After having remov'd every thing that hinders the reuniting of the Lips of a Wound, what is to be done to attain thereto?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Re-Union in Wounds is properly the Work of Nature; but it may be promoted by putting into 'em a little Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> and drawing together their Lips with the Fingers: Afterwards the Lips muſt be kept cloſed with a Bandage, a Glutinous Plaiſter or a dry Stitch, provided the Wound be only ſuperficial, hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Air from penetrating into it. For Want of Balſam of <hi>Peru,</hi> an excellent one may be made with the Flowers here ſpecified.</p>
                  <p>Take the Flowers of Henbane, St. <hi>John's-Wort,</hi> and Comfry and let 'em be digeſted in the Sun during the whole Summer-Seaſon in the Oyl of Hmp-ſeed, which Oyl, the longer it is kept, proves ſo much the better, if it be ſet forth in the Sun every Summer, the Veſſel that contains it being well ſtop'd. There is alſo the Balſam of Balſams, or the Balſam of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> call'd <hi>Samech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To avoid the expoſing of Wounds to the Air, it is requiſite to cover 'em over the Dreſſings with ſome ſort of Plaiſter, which is uſually termed the Surgeon's Plaiſter, ſuch is that which is effectual in Diſſolving, corroborating and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying Pain or Inflammation.</p>
                  <p>Take the Mucilages of the Roots of great Comfrey and Fenegreek, half a Pound of Ceruſe or white Lead, two Drams of Crude <hi>Opium,</hi> one Dram of Camphire, as much of Saffron, two Drams of Sandarack, one of the Oyl of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:39065:79"/>Bays, one half Pound of Roſin, and as much Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine and Wax. Boil all theſe Ingredients to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a ſufficient Quantity of Lin-ſeed-Oyl, and make a Plaiſter according to Art.</p>
                  <p>In great Wounds it is expedient to lay over the Dreſſings a Cataplaſm or Pultiſs, ſuch as this:</p>
                  <p>Take the Leaves and Flowers of Camomile, and Melilot, the Tops of Wormwood, common Mallows and Marſh-Mallows, with the Seeds of Line and Cummin powder'd: Then boyl the whole Compoſition in Wine, and add thereto Barly-Meal, to give it a due Conſiſtence. If there be any Cauſe to fear a Gangrene, you may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo intermix Saffron, Myrrh and Aloes with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Is it neceſſary to put Tents into all Wounds, and to make uſe of Digeſtives and Suppuratives?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No: It is ſufficient to procure the Re-uniting of the Parts ſimply by the Means of Balſam in ſmall Wounds; becauſe they ought not to be brought to Suppuration: ſo that Digeſtives and Suppuratives are only neceſſary in great Wounds, and thoſe that are accompanied with Contuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, avoiding the ill Cuſtom of ſome Country-Surgeons, that ſtuff up their Wounds too much with Tents and Pledgets, whereas they might well be content with ſimple Bolſters or Doſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels which ſhou'd be dipt in the ordinary Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive compoſed of Turpentine and the Yolks of Eggs with a little Brandy, or elſe with the Tincture of Myrrh and Aloes.</p>
                  <p>Suppuration may alſo be promoted by mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and quickening the Wound, eſpecially if the Bolſters be ſteep'd in the following Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>WHAT ought firſt to be conſider'd in a Wound of the Head?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things, that is to ſay, the Wound it ſelf, and the Inſtrument with which it was made; for by the Conſideration of the Wound, we may know whether it be Superficial or Deep; and by that of the Inſtrument, we are enabled to make a truer Judgment concerning the Nature of the ſame Wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Superficial, and what is a Deep Wound in the Head?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is call'd a Superficial Wound in the Head, which lies only in the Skin; and that a Deep one which reacheth to the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> Skull, or Subſtance of the Brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is to be apply'd to a Superficial Wound?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is cur'd with a little Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> Water; or elſe with a little Balſam, laying upon it the Surgeon's Plaiſter, or that of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony. But if the Wound or Rent be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what large, it muſt be clos'd with a Stitch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is to be done to a Deep Wound?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be ſituated in the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> the Wound muſt be kept open, waiting for Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but if it enter the Skull, an Enquiry is to be made, whether there be a Simple Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion, or a Fracture alſo. In the Contuſion it is neceſſary to wait for the Suppuration, and the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:39065:81"/>fall of the Splint, and to keep the Wound open; as in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Fracture, to examine whether it be in the firſt Table only, or in both; it is known to be only in the firſt, by the Application of an Inſtrument, and of Ink; as alſo in regard that there are no ill Symptoms; but a Fracture in both Tables ſhews it ſelf by the Signs; and it may be found out by making a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Inciſion in the Fleſh, to diſcover the Fiſſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the Signs of the Fracture of the tw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>They are the loſs of the Underſtanding at the very Moment of receiving the Wound; an Haemorrhage or Flux of Blood thro' the Noſe, Mouth, or Ears; drowſineſs and heavineſs of the Head, and more eſpecially Vomitting of Phlegm; from whence may be inferr'd the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of making uſe of the Trepan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What Conſequence may be drawn from the Knowledge of the Inſtrument with which the Wound was made?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is according to the Quality of this Inſtrument; as it is proper to cut, prick, or bruiſe; if it be cutting, the Wound is more Superficial, and not ſubject to a great Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: If it be pricking, the Wound is deeper, but of ſmall Moment: If it be a battering or bruiſing Inſtrument, the Wound is accompany'd with Contuſion, producing a great Suppuration, beſides the Concuſſion and Commotion of the Part, which are inſeparable, and often cauſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous Symptoms.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:39065:81"/>
               <p>Inferences may be made alſo from the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wounded Perſon; for a ſtrong robuſt Man may better bear the Stroke than a weak one; and even Anger cauſeth an Augmentation of Vehemency; ſo that all ſuch Circumſtances are not to be deſpis'd, in regard that they give occaſion to profitable Conjectures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What particular Circumſtance is there to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in undertaking the Cure of Wounds in the Face?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is, that a more nice Circumſpection is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd here than elſewhere, in abſtaining from Inciſions, as well as in making choice of proper Medicines, which muſt be free from noiſome Smells; and it is in this Part chiefly that Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſams are to be uſed, avoiding Suppuration, to prevent Scars and other Deformities.</p>

                  <hi>WHAT is to be obſerv'd in Wounds of the Breaſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things, <hi>viz.</hi> whether they penetrate into the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax</hi> or not, which may be diſcover'd by the Probe, and by a Wax-Candle lighted, and apply'd to the Entrance of the Wound, obliging the Patient to return to the ſame Poſture wherein he receiv'd the Hurt, as alſo to keep his Noſe and Mouth ſhut: For then the Flame may be perceiv'd to be waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Orifice of the Opening being full of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:39065:82"/>Bubbles; a Judgment may be alſo made from the running out of the Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is to be done when it is certainly known that the Wound penetrates into the Cavity of the Breaſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is neceſſary to examine what Part may be hurt, by conſidering the ſituation of the Wound, and its Symptoms: If the Lungs are piered, a ſpitting of froathy Vermilion-colour'd Blood en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, with difficulty of Reſpiration, and a Cough. If any of the great Veſſels are open'd, the wounded Perſon feels a Weight at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his Breaſt, is ſeiz'd with cold Sweats, being ſcarce able to fetch his Breath, and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Blood, ſome Portion whereof iſſueth out of the Wound. If the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> or Midriff be cut in its Tendinous Part, he is ſuddenly hurry'd into Convulſions: And if the Heart be wounded either in its <hi>Baſis</hi> or Ventricles, he falls into a Swoon, and dies incontinently.</p>
               <p>But if the Probe doth not enter, and none of the above-mention'd Symptoms appear, it may be taken for granted that the Wound is of no great Conſequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is to be done when the Wound penetrates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cheſt, yet none of the Parts are hurt, only there is an Effuſion of Blood over the</hi> Diaphragm?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>What is an</hi> Empyema?</p>
               <p>It is an Operation whereby any ſorts of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are diſcharg'd with which the Diaphragm is over-ſpread, by making a Puncture or Opening in the Breaſt.</p>

                  <hi>WHAT is to be done to know the quality of a Wound made in the lower Belly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is requiſite to make uſe of the Probe, to obſerve the ſituation of the Wound, and to take notice of all the Symptoms: For by the help of the Probe, one may diſcover whether it hath penetrated into the Cavity or not, after having, enjoyn'd the Patient to betake himſelf to the ſame Poſture wherein he was when he firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Wound: By its ſituation a Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture may be made that ſuch a particular Part may be hurt; and by a due Examination of the Symptoms, one may attain to an exact Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. As for Example; It is known that one of the thick Guts is open'd, when the Hurt is found in the <hi>Hypogaſtrium,</hi> and the Excrements are voided at the Wound; as it is certain that on of the thin Guts is pierc'd, when the Wound appears in the Navel, and the Chyle iſſueth forth from thence; and ſo of the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What Method ought to be obſerv'd in curing Wounds in the lower Belly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is expedient at firſt to prevent letting in the Air, and to dilate the Wound, in order to ſow up the perforated Gut, and afterward to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:39065:83"/>reſtore it to its place; as alſo to bind the Caul, which is let out at the opening, and to cut it off, leſt in putrifying it ſhould corrupt the neighbouring Parts. Then theſe Parts may be bath'd with Lees of Wine, wherein have been boil'd the Flowers of Camomile and Roſes with Wormwood: The Powders of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes, Myrrh, and Frankincenſe may be alſo thrown upon 'em; and the Wound muſt be ſow'd up again to dreſs it on the outſide, the Patient in the mean time being reſtrain'd to a regular Diet. But Clyſters muſt be forborn on theſe Occaſions, eſpecially when one of the thick Guts is wounded, making uſe rather of a Suppoſitory or laxative Diet-Drinks, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void dilatation and ſtraining.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>For the better curing of theſe ſorts of Wounds, it is requiſite to be inform'd of the Quality of the Fire-Arms by which the Wounds were made, in regard that a Muſquet is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than a Piſtol, and a Cannon much more than a Muſquet; as alſo to examine their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and concomitant Accidents; for by how much the more complicated they are, ſo much the greater is the danger. Then the Patient muſt be ſet (as near as can be) in the very ſame Situation and Poſture wherein he remain'd when the Wound was receiv'd, in order to diſcover the direct Paſſage of the Wound by the help of the Probe, with which a ſearch is to be made, whether a Bullet, or any other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous Bodies, as Wood, Flocks, Linnen, or Stuff as yet ſtick in the Wound; ſo that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours may be us'd to take 'em out thro' the ſame Hole where they enter'd, care be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more eſpecially had to avoid making Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacerations
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:39065:84"/>in drawing 'em out: But if the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator hath endeavour'd to no purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move theſe extraneous Bodies, let him make a Counter-Opening in the oppoſite Part, where he ſhall perceive any hardneſs, nevertheleſs without touching the Veſſels; thus the Inciſion being made, he may readily draw 'em out with his Fingers, or ſome other Inſtrument.</p>
                  <p>If the Bullet ſticks ſo far in a Bone that it cannot be taken away without breaking the ſame Bone, it is more expedient to let it lie therein; but if the Leg or Arm-Bones are very much ſplit or ſhatter'd, then the Amputation of 'em becomes abſolutely neceſſary. The Pain and Inflammation of the Part may be aſſwag'd by letting Blood, topical Anodyns, cooling Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Purgations; but in caſe much Blood ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Some Surgeons are of Opinion that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ought to be purg'd every other Day, and even on the very ſame Day that he receiv'd the Wound, if his Strength will permit; however very gentle Purges are to be us'd upon this occaſion, ſuch as Caſſia, Manna, Tamarins, Syr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Violets, and that of White Roſes.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while Anodyns may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to mitigate the Pain; as Cataplaſms or Pultiſſes made with the Crum of white Bread, Milk, Saffron, the Yolk of an Egg, and Oil of Roſes us'd hot; which laſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient is of it ſelf a very good Anodyn. But to aſſwage great Inflammations, Oil of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:39065:84"/>Roſes, the White of an Egg and Vinegar beaten all together, may be laid on the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Parts.</p>
                  <p>At firſt it is neceſſary to apply ſpirituous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines to the Wound, and Pledgets ſteep'd in camphirated Brandy, are admirable for that purpoſe; but if there be a Flux of Blood, ſtyptick Waters, or other aſtringent Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may be us'd, ſtill remembring that all theſe medicaments muſt be apply'd hot.</p>
                  <p>To promote the Suppuration of theſe contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Wounds, a Digeſtive may be made of <hi>Oleum Roſatum,</hi> the Yolk of an Egg, and <hi>Venice</hi> Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine.</p>
                  <p>If the Wound be in the Nerves, Tendons, or other Nervous Parts, it is requiſite to uſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous and drying Medicines, never applying any Ointments, which will not fail to cauſe Putrefaction in thoſe Parts: But a Cataplaſm may be made with Barley-Meal, <hi>Orobus,</hi> I u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins and Lentils boil'd in Claret, adding ſome Oil of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-Wort.</p>

                  <p>If the Wounds are deep, Injections may be made with this Vulnerary Water, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good for all ſorts of Contuſions, as alſo for the Gangrene and U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Take the leſſer Sage, the greater Comfrey, and Mugwort, of each four Handfuls; Plantane, Tobacco, Meadowſweet, Betony, Agrimony, Vervein, St. <hi>John</hi>'s-Wort, and Wormwood, of each three Handfuls; Fennel, Pilewort Bugle, Sanicle, Mouſe-Ear, the leſſer Dazy, the leſſer Centory, and All-heal, of each three Handfuls; three Ounces of round Birth-Wort, and two Ounces of long: Let the whole Compoſition be digeſted during thirty Hours, in two Gallons of good White-Wine, and afterward deſtill'd in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> till one third part be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd.</p>
                  <p>If a Gangrene happens in the Part, Spirit of Mother-Wort may be put into it, which is compounded with two Drams of Maſtick, Myrrh, <hi>Olibanum,</hi> and Amber, and a Quart of recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd Wine, the whole being deſtill'd.</p>
                  <p>This Fomentation may be apply'd very hot to very good purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> an equal quantity of Camphirated Wine and Lime-Water, with three Drams of Camphire.</p>
                  <p>This is alſo an excellent Cataplaſm: Take a Pint of Lye, and as much Spirit of Wine, half an Handful of Rue, Sage; <hi>Scordium,</hi> and Wormwood, a Dram of each of the Roots of both ſorts of Birth-Wort, and two Drams of

                  <head>Of a Burn made by Gun-Powder.</head>
                  <p>If the Burn be recent, and the Skin not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerated, Spirit of Wine or Brandy is to be immediately apply'd; or elſe an Ointment may be made with Oil of Olives, or bitter Almonds, Salt, the Juice of Onions, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juice.</p>
                  <p>If the Skin be ulcerated, and little Bladders or Puſtules ariſe, an Ointment may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with the ſecond Bark of Elder boil'd in Oil of Olives. After it hath been ſtrain'd, add two parts of Ceruſe or White-Lead, and one of Burnt Lead, with as much Litharge, ſtirr'd about in a Leaden-Mortar, to make a Liniment. But it is not convenient to take out the Grains of Powder that remain in the Skin, becauſe they are apt to break, and to be more confounded or ſpread abroad; ſo that they muſt be left to come forth in the Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>When the Wound is ſuperſicial, and the Skin as yet whole, peel'd Onions with common Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney are an excellent Remedy; but if the Skin be torn, it is not to be us'd, by reaſon that the Pain wou'd be too great; in which caſe Oil of Tartar <hi>per diliquium</hi> hath a very good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                  <p>If the Burn be accompany'd with a Fever, it may be allay'd with fixt Nitre, Nitre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:39065:86"/>with Antimony, and Gun-Powder taken inwardly, which are very effectual in their Operation. Crab's-Eyes prepar'd, and even ſome of 'em unprepar'd, are in like manner admirable Remedies.</p>
                  <p>As for external Medicaments, when the Burn is only ſuperficial, take Onions and unſlack'd Lime, quench'd in a Decoction of Rapes, and apply this Liquor very hot, with double Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters dipt therein. Or elſe take what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity you pleaſe of quick Lime well waſh'd, and pound it throughtly in a Leaden-Mortar, with May-Butter without Salt, to make an Ointment, which may be be laid altogether liquid upon the affected Part: Or elſe,</p>
                  <p>Take as much quick Lime as you can get up between your Fingers at two ſeveral times; Milk-Cream and clarify'd Honey, of each about half the like quantity; let the whole be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd to the Conſiſtence of an Ointment, and apply'd: It is an approv'd Remedy; as alſo is the following;</p>
                  <p>Take unſlack'd Lime, and put it into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water, ſo as the Water may appear four or five Finger's breadth above it. After the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcence, pour in Oil of Roſes; whereupon the whole Maſs will be coagulated in form of Butter, and may be apply'd.</p>
                  <p>A good Lotion or Waſhing-Liquor may be prepar'd with the Juice of Garlick and Onions, in recent Burns; otherwiſe make uſe of this Ointment. Take an Ounce and an half of raw Onions, Salt, and <hi>Venice</hi> Soap, of each half an Ounce; mingle the whole Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a Mortar, pouring upon it a ſufficient
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:39065:86"/>quantity of Oil of Roſes, to make a very good Ointment: Or elſe.</p>
                  <p>Diſſolve <hi>Minium</hi> or Litharge in Venegar, filtrate this Liquor, and add thereto a quantity of Rape-Oil newly drawn off, ſufficient to give it the Conſiſtence of a liquid Liniment; then ſtir it about in a Leaden-Mortar till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of a grey Colour, and keep it for Uſe as an excellent Liniment: Or elſe,</p>
                  <p>Pound Crey-Fiſhes or Crabs alive in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar to get their Blood, and foment the Part with it hot; it is a good Remedy: Otherwiſe intermix the pounded Crabs with May-Butter without Salt, and let 'em be boil'd up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſcumm'd, till a red Ointment be made, which may be drawn off, or ſtrain'd for Uſe. And indeed, all manner of Ointments and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Medicinal Compoſitions wherein Crabs are an Ingredient, are true ſpecificks againſt Burns made by Gun-Powder.</p>
                  <p>The Mucilages of the Seeds of <hi>Pſyllium,</hi> or rather thoſe of Quince-Seeds prepar'd with Frog's Sperm, and a little <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> ſpread with a Feather upon the affected Part, have a wonderful Operation in Burns.</p>
                  <p>A Medicament compounded with one third part of the Oil of Olives, and two of the Whites of Eggs well beaten and mixt together, is a very ſimple and ſingular Remedy. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe take half an Ounce of Line-ſeed-Oil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd in Roſe-Water, with four Yolks of Eggs; beat 'em together, and let the whole be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the burnt Part.</p>
                  <p>If the Burn be very violent, and hath many Puſtules, <hi>Etmullerus</hi> is of Opinion that they
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:39065:87"/>ought to be open'd, and that an Ointment ſhou'd be apply'd, which is made of Hen's-Dung boil'd in freſh Butter: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,</p>
                  <p>Take a handful of freſh Sage-Leaves, two handfuls of Plantane, ſix Ounces of freſh But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without Salt, three Ounces of Pullet's-Dung newly voided, and the whiteſt that can be found; then fry the whole Compoſition for a quarter of an Hour; ſqueeze it out, and keep it for uſe: Otherwiſe,</p>
                  <p>Take two Ounces of ſweet Apples roaſted under Embers, Barly-Meal, and Fenugreek, of each half an Ounce, and half a Scruple of Saffron; let the whole Maſs be mingled to make a Liniment or ſoft Cataplaſm, which may ſerve to aſſwage Pain, and mollifie the Skin.</p>
                  <p>If the Wound be yet larger, and hath a Scab, open all the Puſtules, and endeavour the two firſt Days to cauſe the Eſcar to fall off by the Application of a Liniment made of the Mucilages of Quince-Seeds ſteept in Frog's-Sperm, with freſh Butter, the Oil of White Lillies, and the Yolk of an Egg: Otherwiſe,</p>
                  <p>Make a Liniment with freſh Butter well beaten in a Leaden-Mortar, with a Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mallows, which being ſpread upon hot Colewort-Leaves, and apply'd to the Eſcar, it will fall off.</p>
                  <p>But if the Eſcar be too hard and obſtinate, it is requiſite to proceed to Inciſions to make way for the <hi>Sanies,</hi> leſt a deep and putrid Ulcer ſhou'd be engender'd Underneath. As ſoon as the Humour is evacuated, the above-mention'd
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:39065:87"/>Emollient Medicines may be us'd, till the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Eſcar; then the Ulcer may be conſolidated with Digeſtives and Mundifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; ſuch as the Ointment of quick Lime with Oil of Roſes, and the Yolks of Eggs. The white camphirated Ointments, and that of Alabaſter, are alſo good for the ſame Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>If a Gangrene enſueth, Sudorificks muſt be taken inwardly; ſuch are camphirated Spirit of Treacle, the Eſſence and Spirit of Elder-Berries, the Spirit of Hart's-Horn with its own proper Salt, Treacle impregnated with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of camphirated Wine, Scorpion-Water, Hart's-Horn, Citron with Camphire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for external Remedies in the beginning of the Gangrene, the Spirit of Wine apply'd hot is excellent; and yet better if Aloes, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and Myrrh be intermixt therein. It ought alſo to be obſerv'd, that Camphire muſt always be mingled in the topical Medicines for the Cure of the Gangrene.</p>
                  <p>A Decoction of unſlack'd Lime, in which Brimſtone hath been boil'd, with <hi>Mercurius Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> and the Spirit of Wine, is a very efficacious Remedy.</p>
                  <p>In a conſiderable Gangrene, after having made deep Scarifications, let Horſe-Dung be boil'd in Wine, and laid upon the Part in form of a Cataplaſm. This is an approved Remedy.</p>
                  <p>If a <hi>Sphacelus</hi> be begun, ſcarifie the Part, and apply thereto abundance of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptiacum</hi> over and above the Ointments and Cataplaſms already deſcrib'd; remembring al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:39065:88"/>that when the Gangrene degenerates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Sphacelus,</hi> all the mortify'd Parts muſt be incontinently ſeparated or cut off from the ſound.</p>

               <p>It is this, that a Wound always proceeds from an external Cauſe, and an Ulcer from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, ſuch as Humours that fall upon a Part; or elſe a Wound in growing inveterate degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into an Ulcer</p>

               <p>No they ſometimes alſo derive their Origine from internal Cauſes, as the Acrimony of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or their Malignant Quality; the Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Splint of a Bone, and other things of the like Nature. Theſe Ulcers are commonly call'd Primitive, and the others Degenerate.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Putrid Ulcer is that wherein the Fleſh is ſoft and ſcabby, the <hi>Pus</hi> and <hi>Ichor</hi> being viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, ſtinking, and of a cadaverous ſmell.</p>
               <p>The Corroſive Ulcer is that which by the Acrimony and Malignity of its <hi>Sanies,</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes, makes hollow, corrupts and mortifies the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>The Cavernous Ulcer is that the Entrance of which is ſtreight and the bottom broad, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there are many Holes fill'd with malignant <hi>Sanies,</hi> without any calloſity or hardneſs in its ſides.</p>

               <p>To this Purpoſe divers ſorts of Liquors may be us'd, as alſo Powders and Plaiſters: The Liquors are uſually made of Briony-Roots, the greater Celandine, Lime, and Yellow Water; a Tincture of Myrrh, Aloes and Saffron, and Whey, whereto is added <hi>Saccharum Saturni;</hi> ſo that the Ulcers may be waſh'd or bath'd with theſe Liquors; and very good Injections may be compounded of 'em.</p>
               <p>The Powders are thoſe of Worm-eaten-Oak, Allom, and Cinoper, the laſt of theſe being us'd by burning it, to cauſe the Fume to be convey'd to the Ulcer thro' a Funnel. The Country People often make uſe of Potter's-Earth to dry up their Ulcers, with good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:39065:89"/>but then they muſt not be of a Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Nature.</p>
               <p>The Plaiſters are <hi>Emplaſtrum de Betonica, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulphuris, Deſſiccativum Rubrum,</hi> and others; and the Ointments are ſuch as theſe;</p>
               <p>Take three Yolks of Eggs, half an Ounce of Honey, and a Glaſs of Wine, and make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a mundifying Ointment, according to Art: Otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Take Lime well waſh'd and dry'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, let it be mingled with the Oil of Line and <hi>Bolus,</hi> and it will make an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Ointment to mundifie and dry; a little <hi>Mercury Precipitate</hi> may be intermixt (if you pleaſe) to augment the drying Quality; and <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> may be added in the Injections.</p>
               <p>For Ulcers in the Legs, and Cancerous Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, take Plantain-Water and Allom-Water, or elſe Spirit of Wine, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Aegyptiacum,</hi> and Treacle; or elſe an Extract of the Roots of round Birth-Wort made in the Spirit of Wine. Gun-Powder alone diſſolv'd in Wine, is of ſingular Uſe to waſh the Ulcers, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to wet the Pledgets which are to be apply'd to 'em. But here are two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and ſpecifick Medicines to mollifie a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> Camphire, and Soot; let 'em be incorporated with the Juice of Houſe-Leek and Plantain, in a Leaden-Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; then make a Liniment thereof, and cover the Part affected as lightly as is poſſible to be done, as with a ſimple Canvaſs-Cloth, or a Sheet of Cap-Paper: Or elſe,</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:39065:90"/>
               <p>Take the deſtill'd Water of rotten Apples, and mingle it with the Extract of the Roots of round Birth-Wort made in Spirit of Wine; reſerving this Liquor to waſh the Part, and to make Injections.</p>

                  <p>THE Signs of this Diſeaſe are a painful Diſtention of the <hi>Penis</hi> or Yard, and a ſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Pain in making Water, the Urine being pale, whitiſh, and full of Filaments or little Threads: Sometimes the Teſticles are ſwell'd as well as the <hi>Glans</hi> and <hi>Praeputium;</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is a Flux of a kind of Matter yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh, Greeniſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If there be a great Inflammation in the Yard, endeavours muſt be us'd to allay it by letting Blood; and afterward the Patient may take a cooling and diuretick Diet-Drink, as alſo Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions made with cold Seeds in Whey.

                     </hi> into every Quart of Water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Patient is to drink as often as he can: This Decoction is very cooling and diuretick; and the uſe of it ought to be continu'd till the Inflammation be aſſwag'd. Then ſome gentle
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:39065:90"/>Purges are to be preſcrib'd in the beginning; ſuch as an Ounce of <hi>Caſſia,</hi> and as much <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> infus'd in two Glaſſes of Whey, which are to be taken one or two Hours one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Afterward the Patient muſt be often purg'd with twelve Grains of Scammony, and fifteen Grains of <hi>Mercurius Dulcis;</hi> and theſe Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt be continu'd, till it appears that the Fluxes are neither yellowiſh nor greeniſh, nor of any other bad Colour. When they are become White, and grown Thready, they may be ſtopt with Aſtringents: Amber and dry'd Bones beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to Powder, eighteen Grains of each, with one Grain of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> the whole Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being taken in Conſerve of Roſes, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good for this Purpoſe. <hi>Crocus Martis Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens,</hi> or elſe its Extract, taken from half a Dram to a whole Dram, in like manner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the ſame Operation. As ſoon as the <hi>Gonorrhaea</hi> is ſtopt, to be certain of a perfect Cure, a Dram of the <hi>Mercurial Panacaea</hi> is to be taken, from fifteen to twenty Grains at a time, in Conſerve of Roſes. In the mean while, if a ſmall Salivation ſhou'd happen, it muſt be let alone for the preſent, ſince it may be ſtopt at pleaſure by the Purgations. When it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to reſtrain the <hi>Gonorrhaea, Mercury</hi> muſt not be given any longer, in regard that it is a Diſſolvent, which is only good when the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of the Groin or Teſticles are ſwell'd, or elſe when it is expedient to ſet the <hi>Chaude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſſe</hi> a running, after it hath been too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtopt.

                  <head>Of the Pox.</head>
                  <p>This loathſome Diſeaſe begins ſometimes with a virulent <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> and a wearineſs or faintneſs at the ſame time ſeizeth on all the Members of the Body: It is uſually accompany'd with Salivation and the Head-ach, which grows more violent at Night: Pricking Pains are alſo felt in the Arms and Legs, the Palate of the Mouth being ſometimes ulcerated. If it be an inveterate Pox, the Bones are corrupted, and <hi>Exoſtoſes</hi> happen therein; divers Spots with dry, round and red Puſtules appear in the Skin; and the Cartilages or Griſtles of the Noſe are ſometimes eaten up. But when this Diſeaſe is come to its greateſt height of Malignity, the Hair falls off; the Gums are ulcerated; the Teeth are looſe, and drop out; the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is dry'd up; the Eyes are livid; the Ears tingle; the Noſe becomes ſtinking; the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds of the Ears ſwell; the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula</hi> or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late is down; Ulcers break out in the Privy-Parts; Bubo's ariſe in the Groin; as alſo Warts in the <hi>Glans</hi> and <hi>Praeputium;</hi> and <hi>Condyloma's</hi> in the <hi>Anus,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed the Pox may be eaſily cur'd in the beginning; but when it hath taken deep Root
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:39065:92"/>by a long Continuance, it is not extirpated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difficulty, more eſpecially if it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with Ulcers, <hi>Caries,</hi> and <hi>Exoſtoſes;</hi> the Perſon afflicted with it being of an ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and his Voice grown hoarſe.</p>
                  <p>The Spring and Summer are the proper Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Year for undertaking the Cure of this Diſeaſe: In order to which, it is neceſſary that the Patient begin with a regular Diet, lodging in a warm place, and taking ſuch Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as yield a good Juice; as Jelly-broath made with boil'd Fowl: Let him drink Sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick Decoctions, prepar'd with the Wood of <hi>Guayacum, China</hi>-Root, and <hi>Sarſaparella,</hi> and let him abſtain from eating any thing that is high ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd: Let him take Clyſters to keep his Body open; ſometimes alſo he may be let Blood, and purg'd with half a Dram of Jalap, and fifteen Grains of <hi>Mercurius Dulcis.</hi> The Purgations may be re-iterated as often as it ſhall be judg'd convenient; and then the Patient may be bath'd for nine or ten Days, every Morning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening; during which time he may take vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt of Vipers, the Doſe being from ſix to ſixteen Grains; or elſe Viper's-Greaſe from half a Dram to a whole Dram in Conſerve of Roſes.</p>
                  <p>Afterward it will be neceſſary to proceed to Fluxing, which is caus'd by the means of Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>uguentum Mercurii,</hi> which is made of crude <hi>Mercury</hi> ſtirr'd about in a Mortar with Turpentine, and then the whole mingled with Hog's-Greaſe, one part of <hi>Mercury</hi> being uſually put into two parts of Hog's-Greaſe. The Rubbing is begun at the Sole of the Feet,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:39065:92"/>aſcending to the Legs, and the inſide of the Thighs; but the Back-Bone muſt not be rubb'd at all; When the Perſons are tender, or of a weak Conſtitution, a ſingle Friction may be ſometimes ſufficient. Thus the Patient muſt be rubb'd at the Fire, after he hath taken a good Meſs of Broath; but I would not adviſe it to be done with more than one or two Drams of <hi>Mercury</hi> at a time, without reckoning the Greaſe. Then the Patient muſt be dreſs'd with a Pair of Linnen-Drawers or Pantaloons, and laid in his Bed, where his Mouth may be lookt into from time to time, to ſee whether the <hi>Mercury</hi> hath taken effect; which may be eaſily known, by reaſon that his Tongue, Gums, and Palate ſwell and grow thick, his Head akes, his Breath is ſtrong, his Face red, and he can ſcarce ſwallow his Spittle; or elſe he begins to Salivate.</p>
                  <p>If none of theſe Signs appear, the Rubbing muſt be begun again in the Morning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening; then if no Salivation be perceiv'd, for ſometimes four or five Frictions are made ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, a little <hi>Mercurial Panacaea</hi> may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken inwardly, to promote it, During the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the Patient is to be nouriſh'd with Eggs, Broaths, and Gellies; he muſt alſo keep his Bed in a warm Room, and never riſe till it ſhall be thought fit to ſtop the Salivation, which continues twenty or twenty five Days; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till it becomes Laudable; that is to ſay, till it be no longer ſtinking, nor colour'd, but clear and fluid.</p>
                  <p>If a Looſeneſs ſhou'd happen during the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation, it wou'd ceaſe, ſo that to renew it,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:39065:93"/>the Looſeneſs may be ſtay'd with Clyſters made of Milk and the Yolks of Eggs; and in caſe the Salivation ſhou'd not begin afreſh, it muſt be excited with a ſlight Friction: But if it ſhoul'd be too violent, it may be diminiſh'd by ſome gentle Purge, or with four or five Grains of <hi>Aurum Fulminans,</hi> taken in Conſerve of Roſes.</p>
                  <p>Three or four Pints of Rheum are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſalivated every Day in a Baſon made for that purpoſe, which the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent holds in his Bed near his Mouth, ſo as the Spittle may run into it. But if the Fluxing ſhou'd not ceaſe of it ſelf at the time when it ought, he muſt be purg'd to put a ſtop thereto. If any Ulcers remain in his Mouth, to dry 'em up, Gargariſms are to be often us'd, which are made of Barley-Water, Honey of Roſes, or luke-warm Wine.</p>
                  <p>The Warts are cur'd by binding 'em, if a Ligature be poſſible, or elſe they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd with Cauſticks, ſuch as the Powder of Savine, or <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> by corroding the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Parts; ſometimes they are cut, left to bleed for a while, and bath'd with warm Wine.</p>
                  <p>When the Patient begins to riſe, he muſt be purg'd, his Linnen, Bed, and Chamber being chang'd; and afterward his Strength is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited with good Victuals, and generous Wine. If he were too much weaken'd, let him take Cow's-Milk with <hi>Saccharum Roſatum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Pox were not inveterate, the Fluxing might be excited by the <hi>Panacaea</hi> alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Frictions: For after the Phlebotomy,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:39065:93"/>Purgations, and Bathings duly adminiſter'd, the Patient might take ten Grains of the <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Panacaea</hi> in the Morning, and as many at Night; on the next Day fifteen Grains might be given, and the like quantity at Night; on the third Day twenty Grains might be given both Morning and Evening; on the fourth Day twenty five Grains in the Morning, and as many at Night; and on the fifth Day thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Grains in the Morning, and the very ſame quantity in the Evening; continuing thus to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Doſe, till the Fluxing comes in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; and it may be maintain'd by giving every two or every three Days twelve Grains of the <hi>Panacaea.</hi> This Courſe muſt be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally follow'd till the Salivation becomes Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and the Symptoms ceaſe.</p>

                  <p>To prepare this <hi>Panacaea,</hi> it is requiſite to take <hi>Mercury</hi> reviv'd from <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> becauſe it is more pure than <hi>Mercury</hi> which is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately dug out of the Mine. The <hi>Mercury</hi> is reviv'd with <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> after this manner: Take a Pound of artificial <hi>Cinnabar</hi> pulveriz'd, and mighled exactly with three Pounds of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlack'd Lime, in like manner beaten to Powder: Let this Mixture be put into a Retort of Stone, or Glaſs luted, the third part of which at leaſt remains empty; Let it be plac'd in a reverbera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Furnace; and after having fitted a Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fill'd with Water, let the whole be left during twenty four Hours at leaſt; then let the Fire be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:39065:94"/>put under it by degrees, and at length let the Heat be very much augmented, whereupon the <hi>Mercury</hi> will run Drop by Drop into the Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: Let the Fire be continu'd till nothing comes forth, and the Operation will be perform'd gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in ſix or ſeven Hours: Then pour the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of the Recipient, and having waſh'd the <hi>Mercury,</hi> to cleanſe it from ſome ſmall quantity of Earth that may ſtick thereto, let it be dry'd with Cloaths, or elſe with the Crum of Bread: Thus thirteen Ounces of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> may be drawn off from every Pound of artificial Cinnabar.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Panacaea</hi> is made of ſweet Sublimate, and the later of corroſive Sublimate: To make the corroſive Sublimate, put ſixteen Ounces of <hi>Mercury</hi> reviv'd from Cinnabar, into a Matraſs, pour upon it eighteen Ounces of Spirit of Nitre; place the Matras upon the Sand, which muſt be ſomewhat hot, and leave it there till the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution be effected: Then pour off this diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:39065:94"/>will ariſe on the top of the Matras; ſo that the Operation may be perform'd within the ſpace of ſix or ſeven Hours. Let the Matras be cool'd, and afterward broken; avoiding a kind of Flower or light Powder, which flyes up into the Air as ſoon as this Matter is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd; whereupon you'll find nineteen Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of very good corroſive Sublimate; but the red <hi>Scoria</hi> or Droſs which ſettleth at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom muſt be caſt away as unprofitable. This Sublimate being a powerful <hi>Eſcaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> eats away proud Fleſh, and is of ſingular uſe in cleanſing old Ulcers. if half a Dram thereof be diſſolv'd in a Pint of Lime-Water, it gives a yellow Tincture; and this is that which is call'd the <hi>Phagae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donick-Water.</hi>

                  <p>The ſweet Sublimate, of which the <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caea</hi> is immediately compos'd, is made with ſixteen Ounces of corroſive Sublimate, pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd in a Marble or Glaſs-Mortar, intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it by little and little, twelve Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Mercury</hi> reviv'd from Cinnabar: Let this Mixture be ſtirr'd about with a Wooden Peſtle, till the Quick-ſilver become imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible; then put the Powder, which will be of a grey Colour, into divers Glaſs-Vials, or into a Matras, of which two third parts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main empty; place your Veſſel on the Sand, and kindle a ſmall Fire in the beginning, the Heat of which may be afterward encreas'd to the third Degree: Let it continue in this Condition till the Sublimate be made; and the Operation will be generally conſummated
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:39065:95"/>in four or five Hours: whereupon you may break your Vial, and throw away as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, a little light Earth that lies at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. You muſt alſo ſeparate that which ſticks to the Neck of the Vials, or of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras, and keep it for Ointments againſt the Itch; but carefully gather together the white Matter which lies in the middle, and having pulveriz'd it, cauſe it to be ſublimated in the Vials or Matras, as before. This Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt alſo be ſeparated again (as we have already ſhown) and put into other Vials to be ſublimated a third time. Laſtly, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial parts in the bottom, and the fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous in the Neck of the Vials, muſt be, in like manner, ſeparated, ſtill preſerving the Sublimate in the middle, which will then be very well dulcify'd, and amount to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of twenty five Ounces and an half: It is an Efficacious Remedy for all ſorts of Venereal Diſeaſes; removes Obſtructions, kills Worms, and purgeth gently by ſtool, being taken in Pills from ſix Grains to thirty.</p>

                  <p>Take what quantity you pleaſe of ſweet Sublimate, reduce it to Powder in a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or Glaſs-Mortar, and put it into a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras, three quarters whereof remain empty, and of which you have cut off the Neck in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:39065:95"/>the middle of its Height: Then place this Matras in a Furnace or <hi>Balneum</hi> of Sand, and make a little Fire underneath for an Hour, to give a gentle Heat to the Matter, which may be augmented by little and little to the third degree: Let it continue in this ſtate about five Hours, and the Matter will be ſublimated within that ſpace of time. Then let the Veſſel cool, and break it, throwing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as unprofitable a little light ſort of Earth, of a reddiſh Colour, which is found at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and ſeparating all the Sublimate from the Glaſs. Afterward pulverize it a ſecond time, and let it be ſublimated in a Matras, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Thus the Sublimations muſt be reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeven ſeveral times, changing the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſſes every time, and caſting away the light Earth. Then having reduc'd your Sublimate to a very ſine impalpable Powder, by grinding it upon a Porphyry or Marble Stone, put it into a Glaſs Cucurbite or Gourd, pour into it alkaliz'd Spirit of Wine to the height of four Fingers; cover the Cucurbite with its Head, and leave the Matter in Infuſion during fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Days, ſtirring it about from time to time with an Ivory <hi>Spatula.</hi> Afterward ſet your Cucurbite in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> or in a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous Bath, make fit a Recipient to the Mouth of the Alembick; lute the Joints exactly with a moiſten'd Bladder, and cauſe all the Spirit of Wine to be deſtill'd with a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Fire: Let the Veſſels be cool'd, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, and the <hi>Panacaea</hi> will appear at the bottom of the Cucurbite. If it be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:39065:96"/>dry enough, you may dry it up with a gentle Fire in the Sand, ſtirring it with an Ivory or Wooden <hi>Spatula</hi> in the Cucurbite it ſelf till it be reduc'd to Powder. It may be kept for uſe in a Glaſs-Veſſel, as a Remedy of very great Efficacy for all ſorts of Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Diſeaſes, as alſo for Obſtructions, the Scurvy, <hi>Scrophula</hi> or King's-Evil, Tettar, Scab, Scurf, Worms, <hi>Aſcarides,</hi> inveterate Ulcers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Doſe is from ſix Grains to two Scruples, in Conſerve of Roſes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>WHAT are the Diſeaſes incident to the Bones?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are five in number, <hi>viz.</hi> Diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Fracture, <hi>Caries</hi> or Ulcer, <hi>Exoſtoſis,</hi> and <hi>Nodus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Diſlocation or Luxation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the ſtarting of the Head of one Bone out of the Cavity of another, with an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:39065:97"/>of the proper Motion of the Part: Or elſe it is the diſjointing of two Bones united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the Motion of a Part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How many cauſes are there of Diſlocation in general?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two, that is to ſay, one violent, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gentle; thus the Diſlocation is made vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently in Falls, Strains, Knocks, and Blows; but it is done gently and ſlowly in Deflucti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Rheum; as alſo by an inſenſible gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of Humours between the Joints, and upon the Ligaments, the Relaxation or looſening of which gives occaſion afterward to the Head of the Bone to go out of its place; whence this Conſequence may well be drawn, <hi>viz.</hi> that a violent Diſlocation uſually depends upon an external Cauſe, and a gentle Diſlocation upon an internal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After how many manners doth a Diſlocation happen?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two ſeveral Ways; <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt is called compleat, total, and perfect; and the ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat, partial, and imperfect: But both may happen before, behind, on the inſide, and without; and may alſo be ſimple or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the ſigns of a perfect, total, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Diſlocation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is when a hard Tumour or Swelling is perceiv'd near a Hole in the place of the Joint, great pain being felt in the Part, and the Motion of it abolith'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the ſigns of an imperfect, partial, and incompleat Diſlocation?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:39065:97"/>
               <p>It is when the Motion is ſtreighten'd, and weaker than ordinary, ſo that ſome Pain is felt in the Joynt, and a Deformity may be diſcern'd therein, by comparing the hurt Part with the oppoſite which is ſound: This Diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is otherwiſe call'd a Sprain, when it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from an external Cauſe; or elſe it is termed a Relaxation, when it happens by an internal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a ſimple, and what is a complicated Diſlocation or Luxation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Diſlocation is properly ſimple, when it hath no concomitant Accidents; and it is complicated when accompany'd with ſome ill Symptoms or Accidents, ſuch as Swellings, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations, Wounds, Fractures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the means proper to be us'd in a ſimple Diſlocation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſpeedy and ſimple reducing thereof, which is perform'd by ſtretching out the diſlocated or luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Member, and thruſting back the Head of the Bone into its natural place. Afterward the Joynt muſt be ſtrengthen'd with a Fomentation made with Provence Roſes, the Leaves of Wormwood, Roſemary, Camomile, St. <hi>John</hi>'s-Wort, and Oak-Moſs boil'd in the Lees of Wine and Forge-Water, keeping the Part well bound up, and ſuſtain'd in a convenient ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if any ill Conſequence is to be fear'd, apply <hi>Emplaſtrum Oxycroceum,</hi> or <hi>Diapalma</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is to be done in a complicated Diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:39065:98"/>
               <p>The Accidents muſt be firſt remov'd, and then the Bone may be ſet, which is impoſſible to be done otherwiſe; it being dangerous even to make an Attempt before, by reaſon of the too great Violence with which it is effected, and which would infallibly produce a Convulſion or a Gangrene.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Diſlocation be accompany'd with a Wound, muſt the Wound be cur'd before any Endeavours are us'd to reduce it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, but the Symptoms of the Wound, which hinder the Operation, muſt be taken away, as the Swelling, Inflammation, and others of the like Nature; and then it may be reduc'd, and the Wound may be dreſs'd according to the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Method.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Diſlocation be complicated with the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, what is to be done then?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is neceſſary to begin with reducing of the Diſlocation, and afterward to perform that of the Fracture, by reaſon of the Extenſion which muſt be made to reduce the Diſlocation, which would abſolutely hinder the Setling of the Fracture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is the Inflammation and Swelling to be aſſwag'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With Linnen Cloaths dipt in Brandy and common Water, which muſt be often renew'd; or elſe with the Tops of Wormwood and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile, with Sage and Roſemary boil'd in the Lees of Wine, wherein the Bolſters and Bands are to be ſteep'd. But all Repereuſſives and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringents muſt be avoided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How doth it appear that the Reduction is well perform'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:39065:98"/>
               <p>By the Re-eſtabliſhment of the Part in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural State; by its being free from Pain; by its regular Motion; and by its conformity to the oppoſite Part which is ſound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What Diſlocations of Parts are moſt difficult to be reduc'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are thoſe of the Thighs with the Huc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle-Bones, which are almoſt never perfectly ſet; that of the firſt <hi>Vertebra's</hi> is extremely difficult to be reduc'd; and thoſe of the Lower-Jaw and Soles of the Feet are mortal.</p>
               <p>The reducing of Diſlocations is perform'd with greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> facility in Infants than in Perſons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in Years; but it becomes moſt difficult when it is deferr'd for many Days, by reaſon of the overflowing of the <hi>Lympha</hi> and nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Juice.</p>
               <p>If an Inflammation ſhou'd happen before the Member is reduc'd, nothing can be done till it be allay'd, as we have already intimated; but to prevent and mitigate it, the diſlocated Joynt, and the neighbouring Parts, may be bath'd with luke-warm Wine, in which hath been boil'd the Tops of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-Wort, Camomile, Roſemary, <hi>Stoecas Arabica,</hi> and other Ingredients of the like Nature; the Bands muſt be alſo ſteept in the ſame Liquor.</p>
               <p>If an <hi>Oedematous</hi> Tumour ariſe in the luxated Member after the Joint hath been ſet, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to take internal Sudorificks, and to apply Liniments made with the deſtill'd Oil of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and of Human Bones, which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify'd with burnt Hart's Horn, or ſome other part of Animals, to take away its ſtink: Or elſe take yellow-Wax, and very white Roſin,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:39065:99"/>melt the whole Maſs, and put into it white Amber and Gum <hi>Elemi,</hi> a ſufficient quantity of each to make a Compoſition to be incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Balſam of <hi>Peru;</hi> a Plaiſter of which may be prepar'd, and apply'd to the diſlocated Member; but the Plaiſter muſt not be laid a croſs, leſt it ſhou'd contract the Part too much. The whole Member may be alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with Oil of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-Wort, or with the deſtill'd Oil of Turpentine; or rather with a ſimple Decoction of Nervous Plants in Wine.</p>
               <p>If the Bone be put out of its place by a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated ſort of Matter like Mortar or Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Reſolutives and Attenuants are to be us'd, ſuch as the volatile Spirit of Tartar prepar'd with the Lees of Wine, volatile Spirit of Tartar deſtill'd with Nitre in a Retort with a long Neck, or Spirit of Tartar prepar'd by Fermentation with Tartar, and its proper <hi>Alkali:</hi> This laſt is the beſt of all, and the uſe thereof ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd. The volatile Salt of Human Bones is alſo very efficacious; but it is neceſſary to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin firſt with the taking of Laxative and Sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick Medicines, appropriated according to the reſpective Circumſtances. The Spirit of Earth-Worms may be alſo apply'd outwardly, which is made by Fermentation, and may be often laid on the Part either alone, or with the Spirit of <hi>Sal Ammoniack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a diſlocated Bone be not ſet in good time, a <hi>Coagulum</hi> or kind of curdled Subſtance is form'd in the Cavity, which hinders the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of it to its place; but this <hi>Coagulum</hi> may be diſſolv'd with the following Medicament, before you attempt to ſet the Bone. Take one
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:39065:99"/>part of the deſtill'd Oil of Human Bones, two parts of foetid Oil of Tartar; mingle the whole, and add quick Lime to be deſtill'd in a Retort: Let the Parts be fomented with this Oil.</p>
               <p>If the Diſlocation happen'd by the Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ligaments, recourſe may be had to univerſal Sudorificks taken inwardly; as alſo to ſuch Medicines as are full of an unctuous and volatile Salt, particularly Aromatick Oils, and Spirit of <hi>Sal Ammoniack.</hi> In the mean while A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romaticks, Reſolutives, and moderate Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents may be apply'd outwardly.</p>

               <p>It is the Diviſion of the Continuity of its Parts.</p>

                  <hi>After how many different manners may a Bone be broken?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three ſeveral ways, <hi>viz.</hi> croſs-wiſe, ſide-wiſe, in its length, and perhaps in Shatters or Splinters.</p>

                  <hi>By what means may a Bone be fractur'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may happen to be done by three ſorts of Inſtruments, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are fit for brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, cutting, or wreſting; that is to ſay, a Bone may be divided in the Continuity of its proper Parts, by Contuſion, Inciſion, or Contorſion.</p>

               <p>Divers ways, <hi>viz.</hi> by the ill Diſpoſition of the Part, which becomes ſhorter; by its want of Motion; by its flexibility or pliantneſs elſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> where than in its Articulations; by the uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that may be perceiv'd in its Continuity; by the cracking which is heard; ſometimes alſo by the ſhooting forth of one of its ends thro' the Fleſh which it hath open'd; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a Compariſon made thereof with the ſound Part on the other ſide, as that of the Right Arm with the Left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What kind of Fracture is moſt difficult to be diſcern'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is that which happens in the length of the Bone, commonly call'd a Cleft or Fiſſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which gives occaſion to very great Symptoms when it is unknown: But it may be found out by the Pain and Swelling felt at the bottom of the Cleft in touching it; beſides the Conjectures which may be made from the Relation of the Perſon who hath had a Fall, and might have heard the cracking of the Bone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ſort of Fracture is moſt difficult to be cur'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſhattering or ſplitting of a Bone in Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by reaſon of the great Number of Splints which daily cauſe new Pains and Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                  <hi>What is a ſimple and what is a complicated Fracture?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſimple Fracture is that whereby the Bone is broken, without any other Accident; and the complicated Fracture is that which is follow'd by ſome Accident; as that in which there is a ſplitting of the Bone in pieces, or
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:39065:100"/>where the Bone is broken in two ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or elſe when the Fracture is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd with a Luxation, a Wound, an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or other Circumſtances of the like Nature.</p>

                  <hi>In what Parts are the Fractures of Bones moſt dangerous?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are thoſe that happen in the Skull and Joints; in the former by reaſon of the Brain; and in the latter in regard of the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Parts.</p>

               </p>
               <p>He ought to do three things, that is to ſay, at firſt he muſt inceſſantly endeavour to reduce it, to the end that Nature may re-unite the Parts with greater Facility, and that its Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities may be brought together again with leſs trouble, before a Swelling, Inflammation, or Gangrene happen in the Part.

               <p>When the Fracture is Croſs-wiſe, it muſt be reduc'd by Extenſion and contra-Extenſion; and when it is in length, the Coaptation or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together again of the Sides, is only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>

               <p>They are the ſecret and continual Workings of the Fibres, or twitchings, that are felt by Intervals in the Part, with great Pains, which are the Indications of an Abceſs ariſing therein; and when a Wound is join'd to the Fracture, the Lips of it are puff'd up, and become more ſoft and pale, the purulent Matter abounding alſo more than ordinary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the Splints appear, muſt they be drawn out by force?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:39065:101"/>
               <p>By no means; for great care ought to be taken to avoid all manner of violent Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it being requiſite to wait for their going out with the purulent Matter; or at moſt to facilitate their Paſſage by the uſe of Injections of the Tincture of Myrth and Aloes; by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of <hi>Emplaſtrum Andreae Crucii,</hi> and by the help of the <hi>Forceps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is a ſimple Fracture to be dreſs'd, after it hath been reduc'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parts are to be ſtrengthen'd and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidated with Liniments of <hi>Oleum Lumbricorum,</hi> or of Oil of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-Wort mingled with Wine, Brandy, or <hi>Aqua-Vitae;</hi> with Fomentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Red Roſes, Roſemary, and St. <hi>John</hi>'s-Wort boil'd in Wine; and with <hi>Emplaſtrum contra Rupturam,</hi> or <hi>de Betonica,</hi> carefully wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up the broken Member, but after ſuch a manner that the two Fxtremities may not croſs one another; and that a ſmall Space may remain open between both. Afterward the Splints and Bands are to be apply'd, taking care to avoid binding 'em too hard, and to take 'em off every three Days, in order to refit 'em, to abate troubleſome Itchings, and to give Air to the Part; by theſe means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the Gangrene, which might happen by the Suffocation of the natural Heat. If the Thighs or Legs are broken, Scarves are to be us'd to ſupport and ſtay 'em in the Bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ſpace of time may there be allow'd for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Fracture of a Bone?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cure will take up more or leſs time, according to the variety of the Parts, or the different thickneſs of the Bones: Thus to form
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:39065:102"/>the <hi>Callus</hi> of the broken Jaw-Bone, twenty Days may well be allotted; for that of the Clavicle, or that of the Shoulder-Bone, twenty four; for that of the Bones of the Elbow, thirty; for that of the Arm-Bone, forty; for that of the Wriſt-Bone, and thoſe of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, twenty; for that of the Ribs, twenty; for that of the Thigh-Bone, fifty; for that of the Leg-Bone, forty; for that of the Bones of the <hi>Tarſus</hi> and Toes, twenty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ought to be done in particular to promote the formation of the</hi> Callus?</p>
               <p>The fractur'd Part muſt be rubb'd with <hi>Oleum Lumbricorum</hi> and Spirit of Wine heated and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together: The Decoctions of Agrimony, Savine, and Saxifrage are alſo to be us'd, and the <hi>Lapis Oſteocolla</hi> is a Specifick: It is uſually given in great Comphrey-Water, or in a Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Perewinkle made with Wine, and is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten re-iterated.</p>

                  <hi>WHAT is a Fracture of the</hi> Cranium <hi>or Skull?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Wound of the Head complicated with a Fracture of the Skull-Bone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After how many manners may the Skull be fractur'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:39065:102"/>
               <p>Three ſeveral ways, <hi>viz.</hi> by Contuſion, by Inciſion, and by Puncture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the moſt dangerous of theſe Fractures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is that which happens by Contuſion; becauſe the Concuſſion and Commotion is greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Do all the Fractures of the Skull require the uſe of the Trepan?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, the Fractures muſt be deep which ſtand in need of the help of ſuch an Inſtrument; for thoſe that are ſuperficial may be cur'd by a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Exfoliation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is that deep Fracture, wherein the uſe of the Trepan is abſolutely neceſſary?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is that which is made in the two Tables of the Skull, penetrating to the <hi>Meninges</hi> of the Brain; upon which at that time the Blood is diffus'd, and muſt be taken away by the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Trepan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How may it be diſcover'd that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>o Tables of the Skull are broken?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Eyes, and by Ratiocination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Are not the Eyes ſufficient alone, and are they not more certain than Ratiocination?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes; but foraſmuch as things are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſeen, there is often a neceſſity of making uſe of rational Deductions to find out that which the Eyes cannot diſcern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When doth it happen that the Eyes alone diſcover the Eracture?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Wound is large and wide, ſo that it may be immediately view'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When doth it happen that Ratiocination ſupplies the defect of the Eyes?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:39065:103"/>
               <p>When the Wound is ſo ſmall that the Bone cannot be ſeen, and nothing appears but the Accidents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the Accidents or Signs of the Fracture of the Skull?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are a dimmneſs of the Sight, and loſs of the Underſtanding, which happen at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Moment when the Fall or Blow is receiv'd; with the Phlegmatick Vomittings that follow ſoon after: Theſe Signs are call'd <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nivocal.</hi> And there are others that bear the Name of <hi>Equivocal,</hi> and which confirm the former; as a Flux of Blood thro' the Noſe, Eyes, and Ears, redneſs of the Eyes, heavineſs of the Head, and puffing up of the Face; as alſo afterward Drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, Shivering of the whole Body, Fever, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liriums,</hi> Convulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muſt all theſe Signs appear before a Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation can be made of the neceſſity of uſing the Trepan?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, it is ſufficient to have the Univocal Signs to make a Crucial Inciſion in the place of the Wound, and to lay bare the Bone, in order to obſerve the Fracture, which ſometimes is ſo fine, that the Operator is oblig'd to make uſe of Ink, which inſinuates it ſelf into the Cleft, and of a particular Inſtrument, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>How long time is commonly ſpent before the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Accidents?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Summer Seaſon they appear in three or four Days, and at the lateſt in ſeven; in Winter
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:39065:103"/>they are ſlower, and ſometimes do not happen till the fourteenth Day: But at the end of this term, it may be affirm'd that the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan is often unprofitable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is requiſite to be done in a doubtful Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; Muſt the Trepan be apply'd or omitted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Surgeon is to have recourſe to his own conſcientious Diſcretion, which ought to ſerve as a Guide, and requires that we ſhould always act according to the known Rules of Art; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that after having well conſider'd the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, with all the Circumſtances of the Wound, if there be no good grounds for the undertaking of the Operation, it is expedient to deſiſt, and in this caſe to have deference to the Advice of other able Surgeons of the ſame So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, rather than to rely too much upon his own Judgment, to the end that he may be always ſecure from all manner of Blame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is the Trepan apply'd upon the Fracture?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No; but on one ſide of it, and always in a firm place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What Courſe is to be taken when a Fracture is found in a Suture?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A double Trepan is to be made, and apply'd on each ſide of the Suture, by reaſon of the overflowing of the Blood, which may happen therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What Method ought to be obſerv'd in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Wounds of the Head, and Fractures of the Skull?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſimple Wounds of the Head, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary only to make uſe of Balſams, and to lay over 'em <hi>Emplaſtrum de Betonica.</hi> When there is a Contuſion either in the <hi>Pericra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:39065:104"/>or in the Skull, the Wound muſt be kept open till after the Suppuration or Exfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</p>
               <p>When there is only a Bunch without any Wound or Accident, it muſt ſpeedily be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd with Plaiſter or Mortar, Chimney-Soot, Oil of Olives, and Wine, laid upon the Part between two Linnen-Rags; or elſe with Soot, Spirit of Wine, and Oil of St. <hi>John</hi>'s-Wort, wherein the Bolſters are ſoakt, to be in like manner apply'd with a Band.</p>
               <p>Wounds of the Head accompany'd with a Fracture, abſolutely require the application of the Trepan, wherein it is requiſite to make uſe of Oil of Turpentine to be dropt upon the Membrane of the Brain; or elſe Spirit of Wine mingled with Oil of Almonds, and not with the Oil or Syrrup of Roſes; and to endeavour to cauſe a plentiful outward Suppuration.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it muſt not be neglected to enjoyn the wounded Perſon to be let Blood both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after the Operation, if he hath a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or a Plethory; and more eſpecially it is to be remember'd to cauſe his Body to be kept o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at leaſt every other Day, with Clyſters, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>WHAT is</hi> Caries?</p>
               <p>It is the Putrifaction of the Subſtance of the Bone, or elſe its Ulcer or Gangrene.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whence doth the</hi> Caries <hi>of the Bone derive its Original?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It proceeds from an internal and external Cauſe; the former being that which hath been produc'd at firſt in the Subſtance of the Bone; and the other that which takes its Riſe from an inveterate Ulcer in the Fleſh, which hath communicated its Malignity to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Bone, and by that means cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is the</hi> Caries <hi>known which proceeds from an inward Cauſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the continual and violent Pains which are felt before, and continue for a long time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diminution; as alſo afterward by the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fleſh that covers the Bone, and which becomes ſoft, ſpongy, and livid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By what means is a</hi> Caries <hi>that derives its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine from an outward Cauſe, diſcover'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the quality of the purulent Matter that iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth out of the Ulcer in the Fleſh, which is blackiſh, Unctuous, and extremely ſtinking; as alſo by the help of the Probe, that diſcovereth
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:39065:105"/>aſperity or roughneſs in the Bone when it is laid bare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What Means are to be us'd in order to cure a</hi> Caries <hi>proceeding from an external Cauſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Powder of Flower-de-luce may be us'd, and it is ſufficient for that purpoſe, when the <hi>Caries</hi> is ſuperficial; but it is neceſſary to take <hi>Oleum Guyaci,</hi> and to ſoak Bolſters therein, to be laid upon the Ulcer when it is deep; or elſe <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> or Brandy, in which have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd the Roots of Flower-de-luce, Cinnamon, and Cloves. Laſtly, the actual Cautery, which is Fire, muſt be apply'd thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is to be done when the</hi> Caries <hi>proceeds from an internal-Cauſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fleſh muſt be open'd to give Paſſage to the <hi>Sanies</hi> that runs out of the ulcerated Bone, to the end that Exfoliation may be procur'd; and if the Ulcer hath not as yet laid open the Bone on the outſide, the Trepan ought to be apply'd; but the Ulcer or <hi>Caries</hi> muſt be afterward handled, as we have even now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is</hi> Exoſtoſis?</p>
               <p>It is the Swelling of a Bone made by the ſettling of a corrupt Humour in its proper Subſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is</hi> Nodus?</p>
               <p>It is a kind of gummy and wavering Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which is form'd by the ſettling of a groſs Humour between the Bone and the <hi>Perioſteum.</hi>

                  <hi>WHAT is a Veſicatory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Name of Veſicatory may be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to every thing that is capable of raiſing Bladders of Bliſters in the Skin; nevertheleſs in Surgery, by a Veſicatory is underſtood a Medicament prepar'd with <hi>Cantharides</hi> or <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Flies dried, which are beaten to Powder, and mingled with Turpentine, Plaiſters, Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and other Ingredients.</p>

                  <hi>In what places, and after what manner are Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicatories uſually apply'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are apply'd every where, accordingly as there is occaſion to draw out or diſcharge ſome Humour from a Part: In Defluxions of Rheum upon the Eyes or Teeth, they are laid on the Neck and Temples; in Apoplexies, behind the Ears; and ſo of the reſt, obſerving always to make Frictions on the places where the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:39065:106"/>is to be made, to the end that the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicatory may ſooner take effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How long time muſt the Veſicatory continue on the Part?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bliſters are generally rais'd by 'em within the ſpace of five or ſix Hours; yet this Operation depends more or leſs upon the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Skin; and when the Bladders or Bliſters appear, it is requiſite to deferr the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penning of 'em for ſome time, to the end that Nature may have an Opportunity to introduce a new Scarf-Skin, by which means the Pain may be avoided that would be felt, if the Skin were too much expos'd to the Air.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Cautery?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Compoſition made of many Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, which corrode, burn, and make an Eſcar on the Part to which they are apply'd.</p>

               <p>There are two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> the Actual and the Potential; the former are thoſe that have an immediate Operation; as Fire, or a red-hot I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron; and the others are thoſe that produce the ſame Effect, but in a longer ſpace of time; ſuch are the ordinary Cauteries compos'd of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Medicaments.</p>

                  <hi>Which are the moſt ſafe, the Actual or the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Cauteries?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A diſtinction is to be made herein; for Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Cauteries are ſafeſt in the Operation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may be apply'd whereſoever one ſhall think fit, as alſo for as long a time, or for any purpoſe: Whereas the Potential cannot be
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:39065:106"/>guided after the ſame manner. But in Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhages the Potential Cauteries are moſt eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by reaſon that the Eſcar produc'd by 'em not being ſo ſpeedily form'd, the Veſſels are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter clos'd, and they are not ſo ſubject to open again when it falls off; as it often happens in the Fall of an Eſcar made by Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In what places are Cauteries uſually apply'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all places where an Attraction is to be made, or an Intemperature to be corrected, or a Flux of Humours to be ſtopt, by inducing an Eſcar on the Part: However they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid upon the Nape of the Neck, between the firſt and ſecond <hi>Vertebra;</hi> on the outward Part of the Arm in a ſmall Hole between the Muſcle <hi>Deltoides</hi> and the <hi>Biceps;</hi> above the Thigh, between the Muſcle <hi>Sartor,</hi> and the <hi>Vaſtus Internus;</hi> and on the inſide of the Knee, below the Flexors of the Leg; obſerving every where that the Cautery be plac'd near the great Veſſels, to the end that it may draw out and cleanſe more abundantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the Compoſition of the Potential Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They may be made with quick Lime, Soap; and Chimney-Soot; or elſe take an Ounce of <hi>Sal Ammoniack,</hi> two Ounces of burnt <hi>Roman</hi> Vitriol, three Ounces of quick Lime, and as many of calcin'd Tartar; mingle the whole Maſs together in a <hi>Lixivium</hi> of Bean-Cod Aſhes, and cauſe it to evaporate gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a Conſiſtence: Let this Paſte be kept for uſe in a dry place, and in a well-ſtopt Veſſel. Or elſe the Silver-Cautery, or <hi>Lapis Infernalis</hi> may be prepar'd after the following manner:</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:39065:107"/>
               <p>Take what quantity you pleaſe of Silver, let it be diſſolv'd with thrice as much Spirit of Nitre in a Vial, and ſet the Vial upon the Sand-Fire, to the end that two third parts of its Moiſture may evaporate: Then pour the reſt ſcalding-hot into a good Crucible, plac'd over a gentle Fire, and the Ebullition being made, the heat of the Fire muſt be augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till the Matter ſink to the bottom, which will become as it were an Oil: Afterward pour it into a ſomewhat thick and hot Mould, and it will coagulate, ſo as to be fit for Uſe, if it be kept in a well-ſtopt Vial. This Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is the beſt; and an Ounce of Silver will yield one Ounce and five Drams of <hi>Lapis In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernalis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Seton?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a String of Silk, Thread, or Cotton, threaded thro' a kind of Pack-Needle, with which the Skin of a Part is to be pierc'd thro', to make an Ulcer therein, that hath almoſt the ſame effect as a Cautery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is moſt remarkable in the Application of a Seton?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ought to be obſerv'd, that the String muſt be dipt in Oil of Roſes, and that one end of it muſt always be kept longer than the other, to facilitate the running of the Humours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In what Parts is the to Seton be apply'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nape of the Neck is the uſual place of its Application, altho' it may be made in any part of the Body where it is neceſſary. It ſometimes happens that a Surgeon is oblig'd to uſe a kind of Seton in ſuch Wounds made with a Sword, or by Gun-ſhot, as paſs quite
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:39065:107"/>thro' from one ſide to the other; then the String or Skain muſt be dipt in convenient Ointments or Medicinal Compoſitions; and as often as the Dreſſings are taken away, it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to cut off the Part ſoakt in the Puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Matter, which muſt be taken out of the Ulcer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Cupping-Glaſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Veſſel or kind of Vial, made with Glaſs, the bottom whereof is ſomewhat broader than the top, which is apply'd to the Skin to cauſe an Attraction. There are two ſorts of theſe Cupping-Glaſſes, <hi>viz,</hi> the Dry, and the Wet; the former are thoſe that are laid upon the Skin without opening it; and the latter thoſe that are apply'd with Scarification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In what Diſeaſes are Cupping-Glaſſes us'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all kinds where it is neceſſary to make any Attraction; but more eſpecially in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies, Vapours in Women, Palſies, and other Diſtempers of the like Nature. But the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of Cupping-Glaſſes are altogether dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; for in Apoplexes they are generally ſet upon the Shoulders or upon the <hi>Coccyx;</hi> in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours upon the inſide of the Thighs; and in Palſies upon the Paralytick Part it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a Leech?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is an Animal like a little Worm which ſucks the Blood, and is commonly apply'd to Children and weak Perſons, to ſerve inſtead of Phlebotomy: Leeches are alſo us'd for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of a Defluxion of Humours in any Part; as alſo in the Haemorrhoidal Veins when they are too full; in the <hi>Varices,</hi> and in ſeveral parts of the Face.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>What choice ought to be made of Leeches?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is requiſite to take thoſe that have their Backs greeniſh, and their Bellies red; as alſo to ſeek for 'em in a clear running Stream, and to caſt away thoſe that are black and hairy.</p>

                  <hi>WHAT is Phlebotomy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is an evacuation of Blood procur'd by the artificial Inciſion of a Vein or Artery, with a deſign to reſtore Health.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which are the Veſſels that are open'd in Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy or Blood-letting?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are in general all the Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of the Body, nevertheleſs ſome of 'em are more eſpecially appropriated to this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; as the <hi>Vena Praeparata</hi> in the Forehead; the <hi>Ranulae</hi> under the Tongue; the Jugular Veins and Arteries in the Neck; the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Arteries in the Temples; the <hi>Cephalick, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> and <hi>Baſilick</hi> Veins in the inſide of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow; the <hi>Salvatella</hi> between the Ring-Finger and the Little-Finger; the <hi>Poplitaea</hi> in the Ham; the <hi>Saphena</hi> in the internal <hi>Malleolus</hi> or Ankle; and the <hi>Iſchiatica</hi> in the external.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the Conditions requiſite in the due performing of the Operation of Phlebotomy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to make choice of a proper Veſſel; not to open any at all Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; not to let Blood without neceſſity, nor
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:39065:108"/>without the Advice of a Phyſician; whoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it is to determine the Seaſons or Times convenient for that purpoſe; as that of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in an Intermitting Fever; that of Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Summer; and that of Noon-tide in the Winter; and laſtly, to take away different quantities of Blood; for in the Heat of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer they ought to be leſſer, and greater in the Winter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are the Accidents of Phlebotomy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are an Impoſtume, a <hi>Rhombus,</hi> an <hi>Echy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſis,</hi> an <hi>Aneuriſm,</hi> Lipothymy, Swooning, and a Convulſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is a</hi> Rhombus?</p>
               <p>It is a ſmall Tumour of the Blood which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the place where the Operation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd either by making the Orifice too ſmall, or larger than the Capaciouſneſs of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel will admit. The <hi>Rhombus</hi> is cur'd by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it a Bolſter dipt in fair Water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Folds of which muſt be put a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Salt, to diſſolve and prevent the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How may it be perceiv'd that an Artery hath been prickt or open'd in letting Blood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Puncture of an Artery produceth an Aneuriſm; and the Opening of it cauſeth a Flux of Vermilion Colour'd Blood, which iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth forth in abundance, and by Leaps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Are the Leaps which the Blood makes in running, a certain Sign that it comes from an Artery?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, becauſe it may ſo happen, that the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilick</hi> Vein lies directly upon an Artery, the beating of which may cauſe the Blood of the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:39065:109"/>
                  <hi>Baſilica</hi> to run out leaping: Therefore theſe three Circumſtances ought to be conſider'd jointly, that is to ſay, the Vermilion Colour, the great quantity and the Leaps, in order to be aſſur'd that the Blood proceeds from an Artery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How may it be diſcover'd that a Tendon hath been hurt in letting Blood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is known when in opening the <hi>Median</hi> Vein, the end of the Lancet hath met with ſome Reſiſtance; when the Patient hath felt great Pain, and afterward when the Tendon apparently begins to be puff'd up, and the Arm to ſwell. A Remedy may be apply'd to this Accident thus; after having finiſh'd the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, a Bolſter ſteep'd in <hi>Oxycratum</hi> is to be laid upon the Veſſel, a proper Bandage is to be made, and the Arm muſt be wrapt up in a Scarf: If the Inflammation that ariſeth in the Part be follow'd with Suppuration, it muſt be dreſs'd with a ſmall Tent; and if the Suppuration be conſiderable, it is neceſſary to dilate the Wound, and to make uſe of Oil of Eggs and Brandy, or <hi>Arcaeus</hi>'s Liniment, with a good Digeſtive; as alſo to apply <hi>Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum Ceratum;</hi> to make an Embrocation on the Arm with Oil of Roſes; and to dip the Bolſters in <hi>Oxycratum</hi> to cover the whole Part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is it not to be fear'd that ſome Nerve may be wounded in letting Blood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, they lie ſo deep that they cannot be touch'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder what Vein is the Artery of the Arm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is uſually ſituated under the <hi>Baſilica.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:39065:109"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>What Courſe is proper to be taken to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Puncture of an Artery in letting Blood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be felt with the Hand before the Ligature is made, obſerving well whether it be deep or ſuperficial; for when it lies deep, there is nothing to be fear'd; and when it is ſuperficial, it may be eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by pricking the Vein either higher or lower.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is to be done when an Artery is open'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be well open'd, it is requiſite to let the Blood run out till the Perſon falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Syncope</hi> or Swoon, by which means the Aneuriſm is prevented; and afterward the Blood will be more eaſily ſtopt: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains only to make a good Bandage with many Bolſters, in the firſt of which is ſimply put a Counter or a Piece of Money; but a bit of Paper chew'd will ſerve much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with Bolſters laid upon it in ſeveral Folds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Arteries cauſe ſo much trouble when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd accidentally, why are thoſe of the Temples ſometimes open'd on purpoſe, to aſſwage vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Pains in the Head?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By reaſon that in this place the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are ſituated upon the Bones that preſs 'em behind; which very much facilitates their re-union.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Are not the Arteries of Perſons advanc'd in Years more difficult to be clos'd than thoſe of Children?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes.</p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:39065:110"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Are there not Accidents to be fear'd in letting Blood in the Foot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much leſs than in the Arm; becauſe the Veins of the <hi>Malleoli</hi> or Ankles are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd either with Arteries or Tendons; which gave occaſion to the Saying, <hi>That the Arm muſt be given to be let Blood only to an able Surgeon, but the Foot may be afforded to a young Practitioner.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Operation of the Trepan.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is to be perform'd, when it is inferr'd from the Signs of which we have already given a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Account, that ſome Matter is diffus'd over the <hi>Dura Mater.</hi> The Trepan muſt not be us'd in the <hi>Sinus Superciliares,</hi> by reaſon of their Cavity; nor in the Sutures, in regard of the Veſſels that paſs thro' 'em; nor in the Temporal Bone without great neceſſity, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in that part of it which is join'd to the Parietal-Bone, leſt the end of this Bone ſhou'd fly out of its place, ſince it is only laid upon the Parietal; nor in the middle of the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Occipital-Bones, by reaſon of an inner
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:39065:111"/>Prominence wherein they adhere to the <hi>Dura Mater;</hi> nor in the Paſſage of the Lateral <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus's</hi> that are ſituated on the ſide of the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipital.</p>
               <p>If the Fiſſure be very ſmall, the Trepan may be apply'd upon it, altho' it is more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to uſe this Inſtrument on the ſide of the Fiſſure in the lower part; neither is the Trepan to be ſet upon the Sinkings; and if the Bones are looſen'd or ſeparated, there needs no other trepanning than to take 'em away with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levatory</p>
               <p>The Operation muſt be begun with Inciſion, which is uſually made in form of a Croſs, if the Wound be remote from the Sutures, and there are no Muſcles to be cut, and in the ſhape of the Letter T. or of the Figure 7. if it be near the Sutures, ſo that the Foot of the 7. or of the T. ought to be parallel to the Suture, the top of the Letter deſcending toward the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; it is alſo made in the middle of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. If it be ſufficient to make a longitudinal Inciſion in the Forehead; its Wrinkles may be follow'd, and there will be leſs Deformity in the Scar; but it is never done Croſswiſe in this Part, and the Lips of the Wound are not to be cut. If an Inciſion be made on the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcle <hi>Crotaphites,</hi> and on thoſe of the back-part of the Head, it may be done in form of the Letter V. the Point of which will ſtand at the bottom of the Muſcles; nevertheleſs it is more convenient to make a longitudinal Inciſion, by which means fewer Fibres will be cut; and it is always requiſite to begin at the lower part, to avoid being hindred by the Haemorrhage.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:39065:111"/>The Inciſions are to be made with the Inciſion-Knife, and that too boldly when there are no Sinkings; but if there be any, too much weight muſt not be laid upon 'em: Thus the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion being finiſh'd, the Lips of the Skull are to be ſeparated either with the Fingers, or ſome convenient Inſtrument; Then if there be no urgent Occaſion to apply the Trepan, it may be deferr'd till the next Day, the Wound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dreſs'd in the mean time with Plaiſters, Bolſters, Pledgets, and a large Kerchief or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Dreſſing, the uſe of which we ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p>The Operation is begun with the Perforative, to make a little Hole for the fixing of the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid or Pin which is in the Round; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Round is to be apply'd, holding the Handle of the Trepan with the Left-hand, and turning; but when the Round hath made its way, it is lifted up to remove the Pin, leſt this Point ſhou'd hurt the <hi>Dura Mater:</hi> Thus the Round being taken off from time to time, to be cleans'd from the Filings that ſtick thereto, is ſet on again, and the Operator begins his Work of turning anew, which muſt be carry'd on gently when any Blood appears, to the end that the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the piece of Bone which is remov'd may not fly from the ſecond: When it comes near the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> the Operator muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, in like manner, gently, ſearching with a Feather round about the Bone, to obſerve whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſtill continueth his Courſe in the Skull. He muſt alſo often lift up the Trepan to ſearch the Hole, to cleanſe the Inſtrument, and to keep
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:39065:112"/>it from growing hot. As often as the Trepan is taken off, let him ſearch with a Feather, to ſee whether the Bone be cut equally; and if it be not, he muſt lean more on that ſide which is leaſt cut. If it be neceſſary to make uſe of the <hi>Terebella,</hi> the Hole muſt be made in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, whilſt the Bone is as yet firm; and when the Piece begins to move, the <hi>Terebella</hi> is to be put very gently into its Hole, without preſſing the Bone, to draw it out; or elſe it may be taken away with the Myrtle-Leaf, which is an Inſtrument made of a firm Silver-Plate ſomewhat crooked. When the Piece is thus remov'd, the uneven Parts that remain at the bottom of the Hole, are to be cut with the <hi>Lenticula;</hi> and if there be any Sinkings, they may be rais'd with the Elevatory. Whereupon the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> may be compreſs'd a little with the <hi>Lenticula,</hi> to facilitate the running out of the Blood, the Wounded Perſon being oblig'd to ſtoop with his Head downward, ſtopping his Noſe and Mouth, and holding his Breath for a while, to cauſe the Matter to run out: Then the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> may be wip'd with Lint; but if any <hi>Pus</hi> or corrupt Matter lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, it muſt be pierc'd with a Lancet wrapt up in a Tent, that it may not be perceiv'd by the Aſſiſtants.

               <p>But the Hole ought to be well ſtopt with Bolſters, becauſe the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is ſometimes ſo much inflam'd, that it burſts forth; ſo that if any Excreſcences ariſe therein, and go our of the Hole, having ſmall Roots, they may be bound and cut; but if their Roots be large, they muſt be preſs'd cloſe with little Bolſters ſteept in Spirituous Medicines. Here it may not be improper to obſerve, that the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Trepan ought to be perform'd more gently in Children than in adult Perſons, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that their Bones are more tender, and that Oily Medicines muſt not be us'd, but Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The Exſoliation is made ſometimes ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſometimes later; but the <hi>Callus</hi> uſually covers the opening of the Skull within the ſpace of forty or fifty Days, if no ill Accident happens. In great Fractures, where there is no longer any connexion between the Bones, it is requiſite to take 'em away.</p>

               <p>THIS Operation is perform'd when there is a ſmall Body before the Apple of the Eye, which hinders the Sight from entring into it; but it is undertaken only in Blew, Green, and Pearl-colour'd Cataracts, or in thoſe that are of the Colour of poliſh'd Steel; and not in Yellow, Black, or Lead-colour'd. To know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cataract be fit to be couch'd, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's Eye muſt be rubb'd; ſo that if the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taract remains unmoveable, it is mature enough; but if it changeth its place, it is requiſite to wait till it become more ſolid. The Spring and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn are the moſt proper Seaſons for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Operation.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe the Patient being ſet down with his Eyes turn'd toward the Light, and having his ſound Eye bound up, the Surgeon muſt likewiſe ſit on a higher Seat, whilſt the Patient's Head is held by a Servant; and his Eye being turn'd toward his Noſe, is kept ſteady with a <hi>Speculum Oculi,</hi> which is a little Iron-Inſtrument made like a Spoon, pierc'd in the middle, ſo that the Ball of the Eye may be let thro' this Hole: Then the Surgeon taking a a Steel-Needle either round or flat, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he ſhall judge convenient, perforates the Conjunctive at the end of the Corneous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, on the ſide of the little Corner of the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:39065:114"/>Eye, and boldly thruſts his Needle into the middle of the Cataract, which he at firſt puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upward, to looſen it with the Point of the Needle; and then downward, holding it for ſome time with his Needle below the Apple of the Eye. If it aſcend again after it is let go, it muſt be depreſs'd a ſecond time; but the Operation is finiſh'd when it remains in the ſame place whereto it was thruſt; neither is the Needle to be remov'd till this be done, and the Cataract entirely couch'd. In taking out the Needle, the Eye-Lid muſt be pull'd down, and preſs'd a little over the Eye.</p>

               <p>THE Cancer at firſt is not ſo big as a Pea, being a ſmall, hard, blackiſh Swelling, ſometimes livid, and very troubleſome by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its Prickings; but when it is encreas'd, the Tumour appears hard, Lead-colour'd, and livid, cauſing in the beginning a Pain that may be pretty well endur'd, but in the increaſe it grows intolerable, and the Stink is extremely noiſome. When it is ready to Ulcerate, the Heat is vehement, with a pricking Pulſation; and the Veins round about are turgid, being
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:39065:118"/>fill'd with black Blood, and extended as it were the Feet of a Crab or Crey-Fiſh, till Death happen. When this Tumour is not ulcerated, it is call'd an <hi>Occult Cancer;</hi> and an <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> one when it breaks forth into an open Ulcer.</p>
               <p>To palliate an Occult Cancer, and prevent its Ulceration, a Cataplaſm or Pultis of Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock very freſh may be apply'd to the Part. All the kinds of Succory, the Decoction of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanum</hi> or Night-ſhade; the Juices of theſe Plants, as alſo thoſe of Scabious, <hi>Geranium</hi> or Stork-Bill, <hi>Herniaria</hi> or Rupture-Wort, Plantain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are very good in the beginning. River-Crabs pounded in a Leaden-Mortar, and their Juice beaten in a like Mortar, are an excellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; as alſo are Humane Excrements or Urine deſtill'd, and laid upon the Occult Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer: Or elſe,</p>
               <p>Take an Ounce of calcin'd Lead, two Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Oil of Roſes, and ſix Drams of Saffron; let the whole Compoſition be beaten in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar with a Leaden Peſtle, and apply'd. The Amalgama of <hi>Mercury</hi> with <hi>Saturn</hi> is likewiſe a very efficacious Remedy.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Patient may be purg'd with black Hellebore and <hi>Mercurius Dulcis,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king alſo inwardly from one Scruple to half a Dram of the Powder of Adders, given to drink, with half the quantity of Crab's-Eyes: But very great care muſt be taken to avoid the Application of Maturatives or Emollients, which wou'd certainly bring the Tumour to Ulceration.</p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:39065:118"/>
               <p>When the Cancer is already ulcerated, the Spirit of Chimney-Soot may be us'd with good Succeſs; and the Oil of Sea-Crabs pour'd ſcalding hot into the Ulcer, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Remedy. But if it be judg'd expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent entirely to extirpate the Cancer, it may be done thus:</p>
               <p>The ſick Patient being laid in Bed, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon takes the Arm on the ſide of the Cancer, and lifts it upward and backward, to give more room to the Tumour; then having paſs'd a Needle with a very ſtrong. Thread tho' the bottom of the Breaſt, he cuts the Thread to take away the Needle, and paſſeth the Needle again into the Breaſt, to cauſe the Threads to croſs one another. Afterward theſe four ends of the Threads are ty'd together, to make a kind of Handle to take off the Tumour, which is cut quite round to the Ribs with a very ſharp Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. The Cutting is uſually begun in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Part to end in the Veſſels near the Arm-Pit, where a ſmall Piece of Fleſh is left, to ſtop the Blood with greater Facility: Then having laid a Piece of Vitriol upon the Veſſels, or Bolſters ſoakt in ſtyptick Water; the ſides of the Breaſt are to be preſs'd with the Hand, to let out the Blood and Humours; and an Actual Cautery is to be lightly apply'd thereto.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Dreſſing.</head>
                  <p>The Wound is to be dreſs'd with Pledgets ſtrew'd with Aſtringent Powders, a Plaiſter, a Bolſter, a Napkin round the Breaſt, and a Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulary to ſupport the whole Bandage.</p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:39065:119"/>
                  <p>But inſtead of paſſing Threads croſs-wiſe, to form a Handle, with which the Breaſt may be taken off, it wou'd be more expedient to make uſe of a ſort of <hi>Forceps</hi> turn'd at both ends in form of a Creſcent, after ſuch a manner that thoſe ends may fall one upon another when the <hi>Forceps</hi> are ſhut. Thus the Surgeon may lay hold on the Breaſt with theſe <hi>Forceps,</hi> and draw it off, after having cut it at one ſingle Stroak with a very flat, crooked, and ſharp Knife. Neither is it convenient to apply the Actual Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to ſtop the Haemorrhage, becauſe it is apt to break forth again anew, when the Eſcar, is fall'n off.</p>
                  <p>When the Tumour is not as yet ulcerated, a Crucial Inciſion may be made in the Skin, without penetrating into the Glandulous Bodies; then the four Pieces of the Glandules being ſeparated, the Cancerous Tumour may be held with the <hi>Forceps,</hi> and, afterward cut off If there be any Veſſels ſwell'd, they may be bound before the Tumour is taken away; but if the Tumour ſticks cloſe to the Ribs, the Operation is not uſually undertaken.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THIS Operation is perform'd when it may be reaſonably concluded that ſome corrupt Matter is lodg'd in the Breaſt, which may be perceiv'd by the weight that the Patient feels in fetching his Breath; being alſo ſenſible of the floating of the Matter when he turns himſelf from one ſide to another.</p>
               <p>If the Tumour appears on the outſide, the Abceſs may be open'd between the Ribs; but if no external Signs are diſcern'd, the Surgeon may chooſe a more convenient place to make the Opening. Thus when the Patient is ſet upon his Bed, and conveniently ſupported, the Opening is to be made between the ſecond and third of the Spurious Ribs, within four Fingers breadth of the Spine, and the lower Corner of the <hi>Omoplata;</hi> to this purpoſe the Skin is to be taken up a-croſs, to cut it in its length, the Surgeon holding it on one ſide, and the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant on the other. The Inciſion is made with a ſtreight Knife two or three Fingers breadth long, and the Fibres of the great Dorſal-Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle are cut a-croſs, that they may not ſtop the Opening. Then the Surgeon puts the Fore-Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his Left-hand into the Inciſion, to remove the Fibres, and divides the Intercoſtal Muſcles, guiding the Point of the Knife with his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to pierce the <hi>Pleuron,</hi> for fear of wounding
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:39065:120"/>the Lungs, which ſometimes adhere thereto, the Opening being thus finiſh'd, if the Matter runs well, it muſt be taken out; but if not, the Fore-Finger muſt be put into the Wound, to disjoyn thoſe Parts of the Lungs that ſtick to the <hi>Pleuron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To let out the Matter, the Patient muſt be oblig'd to lean on one ſide, ſtopping his Mouth and Noſe, and puffing up his Cheeks, as if he were to blow vehemently; then if Blood ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, a greater quantity of it may be taken away than if it were Matter, in regard that a Flux of Matter weakens more than that of Blood. It is alſo worth the while to obſerve, that in making the Inciſion, the Intercoſtal Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles ought to be cut a-croſs, that the ſide of the Ribs may not be laid bare, by which means the Wound will not ſo ſoon become Fiſtulous.</p>
               <p>If it be judg'd that purulent Matter is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in both ſides of the Breaſt, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that the Operation be done on each ſide; it being well known that the Breaſt is divided into two Parts by the <hi>Mediaſtinum:</hi> But in this caſe the two Holes made by the Inciſion muſt not be left open at the ſame time, for fear of ſuffocating the Patient.</p>

                     <hi>The Dreſſing and Bandage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Wound is dreſs'd with a Tent of Lint arm'd with Balſam, being ſoft, and blunt at the end, which enters only between the Ribs, for fear of hurting the Lungs; but a good Pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get of Lint is more convenient than a Linnen
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:39065:120"/>Tent, however a Thread muſt be ty'd to the Pledget or Tent, leſt it ſhou'd fall into the Breaſt; and Bolſters are to be put into the Wound; as alſo a Plaiſter or Band over the whole. This Dreſſing is to be kepc cloſe with a Napkin faſten'd round the Breaſt with Pins, and ſupported by a Scapulary, which is a ſort of Band, the breadth of which is equal to that of ſix Fingers, having a Hole in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to let in the Head: One of its ends falls behind and the other before; and they are both faſten'd to the Napkin. Thus the Patient is laid in Bed, and ſet half upright. If the Lungs hinder the running out of the Matter, a Pipe is us'd, and the Wound afterward dreſs'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Art.</p>

               <p>THIS Manual Operation is ſometimes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in a Dropſie, when Watry Humours are contain'd in the Cavity of the Belly, or elſe between the Teguments. The Diſeaſe is manifeſt by the great Swelling; and the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is perform'd with a Cane, or a Pipe made of Silver or Steel, with a ſharp Stilet at the end; altho' the Ancients were wont to do it with a Lancet. The Patient being ſupported, ſitting on a Bed, or in a great Elbow-Chair, to the end that the Water may run downward,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:39065:121"/>a Servant muſt preſs the Belly with his Hands, that the Tumour may be extended, whilſt the Surgeon perforates it three or four Fingers breadth below the Navel, and makes the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture on the ſide, to avoid the White-Line; but before the Opening is made, it is expedient that the Skin be a little lifted up. The pointed Stilet being accompany'd with its Pipe, remains in the Part after the Puncture; but it is remov'd to let out the Water; and a convenient quantity of it is taken away, accordingly as the Strength of the Patient will admit. The Stilet makes ſo ſmall an Opening, that it is not to be fear'd leſt the Water ſhoul'd run out, which might happen in making uſe of the Lancet, becauſe there wou'd be occaſion for a thicker Pipe. When a new Puncture is requiſite, it muſt be begun beneath the former; but if the Waters cauſe the Navel to ſtand out, the Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be made therein, without ſeeking for any other place.</p>

                  <p>Is undertaken when thoſe Parts are full of Water, after this manner: Aſſoon as the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is plac'd in a convenient Poſture, either

               <head>CHAP XI. <hi>Of the Operation of</hi> Gaſtroraphy.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is uſually perform'd when there is a Wound in the Belly ſo wide as to let out the Entrails. If there be a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Wound in the Inteſtine, it may be ſow'd up with the Glover's Stitch, the manner of making which we have before explain'd. If
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:39065:122"/>the <hi>Omentum</hi> or Caul be mortify'd, the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Part muſt be cut off; to which purpoſe it is requiſite to take a Needle with waxed Thread, and to paſs it into the ſound Part a-croſs the Caul, without pricking the Veſſels. Then the Caul being ty'd on both ſides with each of the Threads that have been paſs'd double, may be cut an Inch below the Ligature, and the Threads will go thro' the Wound, ſo as to be taken away after the Suppuration. Afterward the Inteſtines are to be put up again into the Belly, by thruſting 'em alternately with the end of the Fingers. But if they cannot be reſtor'd to their proper Place without much difficulty, Spirituous Fomentations may be made with an handful of the Flowers of Camomile and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilot, an Ounce of Aniſe, with as much Fennel and Cummin-Seeds; half an Ounce of Cloves and Nutmegs: Let the whole Maſs be boil'd in Milk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> adding an Ounce of Camphirated Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, and two Drams of <hi>Saccharum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turni,</hi> with two Scruples of Oil of Aniſe, and bathe the Entrails with this Fomentation very hot. Otherwiſe,</p>
               <p>Apply Animals cut open alive; or elſe boil Skeins of raw Thread in Milk, and foment 'em with this Decoction in like manner very hot.</p>
               <p>Before the Suture or Stitching of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines is made, it is expedient to foment 'em with Spirit of Wine, in which a little Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire hath been diſſolv'd: But if they be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd, they muſt not be ſown up again, but fomented with Spirituous Liquors. No Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are to be given to the Patient, for fear
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:39065:122"/>cauſing the Inteſtine to ſwell; but a Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory may be apply'd: Or elſe he may make uſe of a Laxative Diet-Drink, if it be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to open his Body: He ought alſo to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry temperate and abſtemious during the Cure, ſo as to take no other Suſtenance than Broths and Gellies.</p>
               <p>If the Inteſtines cannot be put up again, the Wound is to be dilated, avoiding the White-Line, and that too at the bottom rather than at the Top, if it be above. To this purpoſe the Inteſtines are to be rank'd along the ſide of the Wound, and a Bolſter is to be laid upon 'em dipt in warm Wine, which may be held by ſome Aſſiſtant. Then the Surgeon introduceth a channel'd Probe into the Belly, and takes a great deal of care to ſix the Inteſtine between the Probe and the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> which may be effected by drawing out the Inteſtine a little; then holding the Probe with his Left-hand, to fit a crooked Inciſion-Knife in its chanelling, he cuts the Teguments equally both on the outſide and within, and thruſts back the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails alternately into the Wound with his Fore-Finger.</p>
               <p>The Stitch muſt be intermitted, being made with two crooked Needles threaded at each end with the ſame Thread. The Surgeon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at firſt put the Fore-Finger of his Left-Hand into the Belly, to retain the <hi>Peritoneaum,</hi> Muſcles, and Skin on the ſide of the Wound, paſſeth the Needle with his other Hand into the Belly, the Point of which is gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Fore-Finger, and penetrates very far: Then he likewiſe paſſeth the other Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:39065:123"/>thro' the other Lip of the Wound into the Belly, obſerving the ſame thing as in the former, and without taking his Fingers off from the Belly. If there are many Points or Stitches to be made, they may be done after the ſame manner, without removing the Fingers from the Part, whilſt a Servant draws together the Lips of the Wound, and ties the Knots. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Wound may be dreſs'd, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives or Dreſſings kept cloſe to the Part with the Napkin and Scapulary. But the Patient muſt be oblig'd to lie on his Belly for ſome Days ſucceſſively, to cicatrize the Wound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or that of the Entrails.</p>
               <p>If the Inteſtine were entirely cut, it wou'd be requiſite to ſow it up round about the Wound, after ſuch a manner that ſome part of it may always remain open; for if the Patient ſhou'd recover, his Excrements might be voided thro' the Wound; of which Accident we have an Example in a Soldier belonging to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital <hi>Des Invalides</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> who liv'd a long time in this Condition.</p>

               <p>THIS Operation is neceſſary when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines or Entrails have made a kind of Rupture in the Navel, and may be perform'd thus: When the Patient is laid upon his Back, an Inciſion is to be made on the Tumour to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:39065:123"/>the Fat, by griping the Skin, if it be poſſible, or elſe it may be done without taking it up. Then the Membranes are to be divided with a Fleam to lay open the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> for fear of cutting the Inteſtine; and as ſoon as the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum</hi> appears, it may be drawn upward with the Nails, in order to make a ſmall O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening therein with ſome cutting Inſtrument: Whereupon the Surgeon having put the Fore-Finger of his Left-Hand into the Belly to guide the Point of the Sizzers, with which the Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is enlarg'd, reſtores the Inteſtine to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Place, and looſens the Caul if it ſtick to the Tumour: But if the Entrails are faſten'd to the Caul, it is requiſite to ſeparate 'em by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a little of the Caul, rather than to touch the Inteſtine; which laſt being reduc'd, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant may preſs the Belly on the ſide of the Wound; ſo that if a Maſs of Fleſh be found in the Caul, which hath been form'd by the ſticking of the Caul to the Muſcles and <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum,</hi> this Fleſhy Maſs muſt be entirely looſen'd, and then a Ligature may be made to take it away, with ſome part of the Caul, as we have already ſhewn in the <hi>Gaſtroraphy.</hi> Afterward the Stitch is to be made, as in that Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the Wound muſt be dreſs'd, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſame Precautions.

The Inteſtine muſt be gently handl'd, to diſſolve the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements; and thoſe Parts muſt be afterward put up again into the Belly (if it be poſſible) with the two Fore-Fingers, thruſting 'em al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatively; but if they cannot be reduc'd, the Wound is to be dilated upward, by introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a channell'd Probe into the Belly, to let the Sizzers into its Channelling. If the Probe cannot enter, the Inteſtine muſt be taken out a little, laying a Finger upon it near the Ring, and making a ſmall Scarification in the Ring, with a ſtreight Inciſion-Knife guided with the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:39065:124"/>Finger, to let in the Probe, into which may be put a crooked Knife, to cut the Ring; that is to ſay, to dilate the Wound on the inſide; but care muſt be had to avoid penetrating too far, for fear of dividing a Branch of Arteries; and then the Parts may be put up into the Belly. If the Caul had caus'd the Rupture, it wou'd be requiſite to bind it, and to cut off whatſoever is corrupted, ſcarifying the Ring on the inſide, to to make a good Cicatrice or Scar.</p>

Then Pledgets are to be put into the Wound, after they have been dipt in a good Digeſtive, ſuch as Turpentine with the Yolk of an Egg, applying at the ſame time a Plaiſter, a Bolſter of a Triangular Figure, and the Bandage call'd <hi>Spica,</hi> which is made much after the ſame manner as that which is us'd in the Fracture of the Clavicle.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of the Operation of <hi>Lithotomy.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS Operation is undertaken when it is certainly known that there is a Stone in the Bladder; to be aſſur'd of which, it may not be improper to introduce a Finger into the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> near the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> by which means the Stone is ſometimes felt, if there be any: The Finger is likewiſe uſually put into the <hi>Anus</hi> of young Virgins, and into the <hi>Vagina <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>teri</hi> of Women, for the ſame purpoſe. But it is more expedient to make uſe of the Probe, anointed with Greaſe, after this manner: The Patient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid on his Back, the Operator holds the Yard ſtreight upward, the <hi>Glans</hi> lying open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Thumb and Fore-finger; then hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Probe with his Right-hand on the ſide of the Rings, he guides it into the Yard, and when it is enter'd, turns the Handle toward the <hi>Pubes,</hi> drawing out the Yard a little, to the end that the Canal of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reter</hi> may lie ſtreight. If it be perceiv'd that the Probe hath not as yet paſs'd into the Bladder, a Finger is to be put into the <hi>Anus,</hi> to conduct it thither. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in order to know whether a Stone be lodg'd in the Bladder, the Probe ought to be ſtaken a little therein, firſt on the Right-ſide, and then on the Left; and if a ſmall Noiſe be heard, it may be concluded for certain that there is a Stone: But if it be judg'd that the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:39065:127"/>Stone ſwims in the Bladder, ſo that it cannot be felt, the Patient muſt be oblig'd to make Water with a hollow Probe.</p>
               <p>Another manner of ſearching may be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd thus: Let the Yard be rais'd upward, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining a little to the ſide of the Belly; let the Rings of the Probe be turn'd upon the Belly, and the end on the ſide of the <hi>Anus;</hi> and then let this Inſtrument be introduc'd, ſhaking it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle on both ſides, to diſcover the Stone.</p>
               <p>In order to perform the Operation of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thotomy, the Patient muſt be laid along upon a Table of a convenient height, ſo as that the Surgeon may go about his Work ſtanding; the Patient's Back muſt alſo lean upon the Back of a Chair laid down, and trimm'd with Linnen-Cloth, leſt it ſhou'd hurt his Body; his Legs muſt be kept aſunder, and the Soles of his Feet on the ſides of the Table, whilſt a Man gets up behind him to hold his Shoulders: His Arms and Legs muſt be alſo bound with Straps or Bands. Then a channell'd Probe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put up into the Bladder, a Servant ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Table on the ſide of the Chair, holds the Back of the Inſtrument between his two Fore-fingers on that Part of the <hi>Perinae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> where the Inciſion ought to be begun, which is to be made between his Fingers with a ſharp Knife that cuts on both ſides: The Inciſion may be three or four Fingers breadth on the left ſide of the <hi>Raphe</hi> or Suture: But in Children its length muſt not exceed two Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers breadth. If the Inciſion were too little to give Paſſage to the Stone, it wou'd be more expedient to enlarge it than to ſtretch the Wound
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:39065:127"/>with the Dilatators. When the Convex Part where the channelling of the Probe lies, ſhall be well laid open, the Conductors may be ſlipt into the ſame Channelling, between which the <hi>Forceps</hi> is to be put, having before taken away the Probe. Some Operators make uſe of a <hi>Gorgeret</hi> or Introductor to that purpoſe, conveying the end of it into the Chanelling of the Probe; which is remov'd to introduce the <hi>Forceps</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bladder: And as ſoon as they are fixt therein, the Conductors or <hi>Gorgeret</hi> muſt be likewiſe taken out. Afterward ſearch being made for the Stone, it muſt be held faſt, and drawn out of the Bladder: But if the Stone be long, and the Operator hath got hold thereof by the two Ends, he muſt endeavour to lay hold on it again by the Middle, to avoid the great ſcattering which wou'd happen in the Paſſage. The Stones are alſo ſometimes ſo large, that there is an abſolute neceſſity of leaving 'em in the Bladder. Again, if the Stone ſticks very cloſe to the Bladder, the Extraction ought to be deferr'd for ſome time; and perhaps it may be looſen'd in the Suppuration. Laſtly, when the Stone hath been taken out, an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor is uſually introduc'd into the Bladder, to remove the Gravel, Fragments, and Clots of Blood.</p>
               <p>After the Operation, the Patient is carry'd to his Bed, having before cover'd the Wound with a good Bolſter; and if an Haemorrhage happens, it is to be ſtopt with Aſtringents, A Tent muſt alſo be put into the Wound, when it is ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that ſome Stone or Gravel may as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main therein: But if it evidently appears that
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:39065:128"/>there is none, the Wound may be dreſs'd with Pledgets, a Plaiſter, and a Bolſter, of a Figure convenient for the Part. The Dreſſing may be ſtaid with a Sling ſupported by a Scapula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; or elſe the Bandage of the double T. may be us'd, the manner of the Application of which we have ſhewn elſewhere. The Patient's Thighs muſt be drawn cloſe one to another, and ty'd with a ſmall Band, leſt they ſhou'd be ſet aſunder again.</p>
               <p>The Operation of Lithotomy in Women is uſually perform'd by the leſſer Preparative, which is done by putting the Fore-finger and Middle-finger into the <hi>Vagina <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>teri,</hi> or into the <hi>Rectum</hi> in young Virgins, to draw the Stone to the Neck of the Bladder, and keep it ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo that it may be taken out with a Hook, or other Inſtrument.</p>
               <p>This Operation may alſo be effected in Women, almoſt in the ſame manner as in Men; for after having caus'd the Female Patient to be ſet in the ſame Poſture or Situation as the Men are uſually plac'd, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Deſcription, the Conductors may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd into the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reter,</hi> to let in the <hi>Forceps</hi> between 'em, with which the Stone may be drawn out: But if it be too thick, a ſmall Inciſion is to be made in the Right and Left ſide of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The leſſer Preparative was formerly us'd in the Lithotomy of Men, after this manner: The Finger was put into the <hi>Anus,</hi> to draw the Stone toward the <hi>Perinaeum;</hi> then an Inciſion was made upon the Stone on the ſide of the Suture, and it was taken out with an Inſtrument.</p>

               <p>FISTULA's are callous Ulcers: If one of theſe happen in the Fundament, and is open on the outſide, it may be cur'd thus: After the Patient hath been laid upon his Belly on the ſide of a Bed, with his Legs aſunder, the Surgeon makes a ſmall Inciſion with his Knife in the Orifice of the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> in order to paſs therein another ſmall crooked Inciſion-Knife, at the end of which is a Pointed Stilet with a little Silver Head which covers it, to the end that it may enter without cauſing Pain. When the Surgeon hath convey'd his Knife into the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:39065:129"/>
                  <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> having the Fore-finger of his Left-hand in the <hi>Anus</hi> or Fundament, he pulls off its Head, holding the Handle with one Hand, and the Stilet that pierceth the <hi>Anus</hi> with the other; and at laſt draws our the Inſtrument to cut the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> entirely at one Stroke.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> hath an Opening into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtine, an Inciſion is to be made on the outſide at the Bottom thereof, to open it in the Place where a ſmall Tumour or Inflammation uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, or elſe in the Place where the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient feels a Pain when it is touch'd. If the Tumour be remote from the <hi>Anus,</hi> it may be open'd with the Potential Cautery, to avoid a greater Inconvenience. After having thus laid open the very bottom, the little Inciſion-Knife and Stilet, with its Head, is to be paſs'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the end of the Stilet is to be drawn thro' the <hi>Anus,</hi> and the Fleſh is to be cut all at once. But if the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> be ſituated too far forward in the Fundament, the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the <hi>Anus</hi> muſt not be entirely cut, otherwiſe the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot be any longer retain'd. Laſtly, when the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> hath been treated after this manner, all its Sinuoſities or Winding-Paſſages ought likewiſe to be open'd, and the Wound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fill'd with thick Pledgets ſteept in ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodyn, is to be cover'd with a Plaiſter and a Triangular Bolſter; as alſo with the Bandage call'd the T.</p>

               <p>IT is requiſite to undertake this Operation when the Tendons are cut, and when they become very thick. If the Wound be heal'd, it muſt be open'd again to diſcover the Tendon, and the Part muſt be bended, to draw together again the ends of the Tendons. Then the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon taking a flat, ſtreight, and fine Needle, with a double waxed Thread, paſſeth it into a ſmall Bolſter, and makes a Knot at the end of the Thread, to be ſtopt upon the Bolſter. Afterward he pierceth the Tendon from the outſide to the inſide, at a good diſtance, leſt the Thread ſhou'd tear it, and proceeds to paſs the Needle in like manner under the other end of the Tendon, upon which is laid a ſmall Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, for the Thread to be ty'd in a Knot over it. Then he cauſeth the Extremities of the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons to lie a little one upon another, by bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Part, and dreſſeth the Wound with ſome Balſam. It may not be improper here to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that Ointments are never to be apply'd to the Tendons, which wou'd cauſe 'em to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſie, but altogether Spirituous Medicaments; and that the Part muſt be bound up, leſt the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of it ſhou'd ſeparate the Tendons.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Of the Operation of <hi>Amputation,</hi> with its proper Dreſſings and Bandages.</head>
               <p>THE Leg is uſually cut off at the Ham; the Thigh as near as can be to the Knee; and the Arm as near as is poſſible to the Wriſt: But an Amputation is never made in a Joynt, except in the Fingers and Toes.</p>
               <p>In order to cut off a Leg the Patient is to be ſet on the ſide of his Bed, or in a Chair; and ſupported by divers Aſſiſtants; one of 'em be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing employ'd to hold the J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eg at the bottom, and another to draw the Skin upward above the Knee, to the end that the Fleſh may cover the Bone again after the Operation. In the mean while a very thick Bolſter is laid under the Ham, upon which are made two Ligatures, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt above the Knee, to ſtop the Blood, by ſcrewing it up with the <hi>Tourniquet</hi> or <hi>Gripe-Stick;</hi> and the ſecond below the Knee, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Fleſh firm for the Knife. Before the Ligature is drawn cloſe with the <hi>Gripe-Stick,</hi> a little piece of Paſte-board is to be put under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, for fear of pinching the Skin. Thus the Leg being well fixt, the Surgeon placeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf between both the Legs of the Patient, to make the Inciſion with a crooked Knife, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it circularly to the Bone, and laying one Hand upon the Back of the Knife, which muſt, have no Edge. Afterward the <hi>Perioſteum</hi> is to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:39065:131"/>ſcrap'd with an Inciſion-Knife, and the Fleſh with the Veſſels that lie between the two Bones are to be cut. When the Fleſh is thus ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, a Cleft Band is to be laid upon it, with which the Heads are croſs'd, to draw the Fleſh upward, to the intent that the Bones may be cut farther, and that it may cover 'em after the Amputation, as alſo to facilitate the Paſſage of the Saw. Then the Surgeon holds the Leg with his Left-hand, and ſaweth with his Right, which he lets fall upon the two Bones, to divide 'em aſunder at the ſame time, beginning with the <hi>Perone</hi> or <hi>Fibula,</hi> and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>Tibia.</hi> But it is neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Saw, and to go gently in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to make way for it, and afterward to work it faſter. The Leg being cut off, the Ligature muſt be unty'd below the Knee, looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the <hi>Gripe-Stick,</hi> to let the Blood run a little, and to diſcern the Veſſels with greater facility; and then the <hi>Gripe-Stick</hi> may be twiſted again, to ſtop the Blood; which ſome Surgeons effect, by laying Pieces of Vitriol up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Opening of the Arteries, and Aſtringent Powders, on a large Bolſter of Cotton or Tow, to be apply'd to the end of the Stump; but if ſuch a method be us'd, it is requiſite that ſome Perſon be employ'd to keep on the whole Dreſſing with his Hand during twenty four Hours. However this Cuſtom hath prevail'd in the Hoſpital of <hi>Hôtel-Dieu</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others make a Ligature of the Veſſels, taking up the ends of 'em with a pair of <hi>Forceps,</hi> having a Spring; or with the <hi>Valet a Patin,</hi> which is a ſort of Princers that are clos'd with a ſmall
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:39065:131"/>Ring let down to the bottom of the Branches. Theſe Pincers being held by a Servant, the Surgeon paſſeth a Needle with wax'd Thread, into the Fleſh, below the Veſſel, bringing it back again, and with the two ends of the Thread makes a good Ligature upon the ſame Veſſel; then he looſeth the <hi>Gripe-Stick</hi> and the Band, the Stump is to be ſomewhat bended, and the Fleſh let down to cover the Bones.</p>

                  <head>The Dreſſing and Bandage.</head>
                  <p>After the Operation, it is requiſite to lay ſmall Bolſters upon the Veſſels, and dry Pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets upon the two Bones, as alſo many other Folds of Linnen ſtrew'd with Aſtringent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and over all another large Bolſter or Pledget of Cotton or Tow, cover'd in like manner with Aſtringent Powders; then the whole Dreſſing is to be wrapt up with a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and a Bolſter, in form of a <hi>Malta</hi> Croſs; ſo that there are three or four Longitudinal Bolſters, and one Circular.</p>
                  <p>The Surgeon uſually begins to apply the <hi>Milta</hi> Croſs and Bolſter under the Ham, croſſing the Heads or Ends upon the Stump, and cauſeth 'em to be held by a Servant that Supports the Part; then he likewiſe croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the other Heads, and layeth on the two Longitudinal Bolſters that croſs each other in the middle of the Stump, together with a third Longitudinal, which is brought round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Stump, to ſtay the two former: Theſe Bolſters ought to be three Fingers broad, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long, to paſs over the Stump.

                  <p>The <hi>Capeline</hi> or Head-Bandage, having two Heads, is made with a Band of the ſame breadth, but ſomewhat longer.

               <p>THIS Operation is perform'd when the Surgeon hath prickt an Artery, or when a Tumour ariſeth in an Artery.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe the Patient is ſet in a Chair, and a Servant employ'd in holding his Arm in a Poſture proper for the Operation; then a Bolſter is to be laid four double, following the Progreſs of the Artery, to the end that the Ligature may better preſs the Veſſel; and the Arm may be alſo ſurrounded with another ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Bolſter, on which is made a Ligature ſcrew'd up with a <hi>Gripe-Stick,</hi> provided the Arm be not too much ſwell'd; for in this Caſe it wou'd be more expedient to deferr the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for fear of a Gangrene. The Artery being thus well ſtopt, the Surgeon lays hold on the Arm with one Hand, below the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and with the other makes an Inciſion with his Lancet, beginning at the bottom of the Tumour, and ending on the top along the Progreſs of the Artery. When the Tumour is open'd, the coagulated Blood may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd with a Finger; and if there are any Strings at the bottom, they may be cut with a crooked Pair of Sizzers, to the end that all the Clods of Blood, and other extraneous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which are ſometimes form'd in <hi>Aneuriſms</hi> when they are very inveterate) may be more

In the mean time the Surgeon gives the Inſtrument to a Servant to hold, whilſt he paſſeth under the Artery a crooked Needle with a wax'd String, cuts the Thread, and takes away the Needle: The he begins to make the Ligature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Opening of the Artery, tying at firſt a ſingle Knot, on which may be put (if you pleaſe) a ſmall Bolſter, that may be kept ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with two other Knots: It is alſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that another Ligature be made in the lower part of the Artery, by reaſon that the little lateral Arteries might otherwiſe let out Blood.</p>
               <p>The Artery ought not to be cut between the two Ligatures, leſt the firſt Ligature ſhou'd be forc'd by the Impulſion of the Blood; but the Thread muſt be let fall, that it may rot with the Suppuration. Then the Wound may be dreſs'd with Pledgets, Bolſters ſtrew'd with Aſtringent Powders and a Plaiſter; a Bolſter being alſo laid in the Fold of the Elbow.</p>

               <p>TO perform this Operation, the Surgeon holds the Lancet between his Thumb and Fore-finger, and three other Fingers lying upon the Patient's Arm, and thruſts the Point of the Lancet into the Veſſel, carrying the ſame Point ſomewhat upward, to make the Orifice the greater. If a Tendon, which is known by its hardneſs; or an Artery, which is diſcover'd by Pulſation, appear beyond the Vein, and very near it, the Lancet muſt be only ſet very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:39065:134"/>in the Vein, and drawn back again ſtreight, without turning it up, otherwiſe the Artery of Tendon wou'd be certainly cut with the Point. If the Artery or Tendon lies immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Vein, the later muſt be prickt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what underneath, holding the Lancet inclin'd ſide-ways, and thruſting it very little forward; ſo that the Point will finiſh the Opening, by turning it upward.</p>
               <p>If the Artery ſtick too cloſe to the Vein, the later is to be prickt higher or lower than it is ordinarily done; and if the Vein be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, and lie cloſe upon a hard Muſcle, the Lancet muſt not be thruſt downright into the Vein, but it is requiſite to carry it ſomewhat obliquely, and to take the Veſſel above, leſt the Muſcle and its Membrane ſhou'd be prickt, which wou'd cauſe a great deal of Pain, and perhaps a vehement Inflammation. It is well known that the Veins of the Right Arm are uſually open'd with the Right-hand, and thoſe of the Left-Arm with the Left-hand.</p>
               <div type="part">

                  <p>Is made thus: The Surgeon having laid a Bolſter upon the Orifice, keeps it cloſe with two Fingers, and holds the Band or Fillet with the other Hand; then taking one end of the Fillet with the Middle-Finger, Fore-Finger, and Thumb, and applying it to the Bolſter, he makes with the longeſt end of the Fillet divers Figures in form of the Letters KY in the Fold of the Arm; as alſo a back-fold with the ſhorter end of the Fillet, held between three
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:39065:134"/>Fingers. Afterward both ends of the Fillet are ty'd beneath the Elbow.</p>
                  <p>If an Inflammation happens after the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, The Bolſters are to be dipt in <hi>Oxycratum:</hi> but if the Orifice were ſo ſmall as to produce a <hi>Rhombus,</hi> it wou'd be requiſite to preſs the Wound often with two Fingers, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to apply a Bolſter dipt in <hi>Oxycratum.</hi>

But care is to be had to avoid thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em up too far, for fear of hurting the fides of the Noſe; and they are to be anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Oil of Turpentine mixt with Spirit of Wine: Theſe Pipes are alſo to have little Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, with which they may be faſten'd to the Cap. If there be no Wound in the Noſe, there will be no need of a Bandage; but if the Fracture be accompany'd with a Wound, after having apply'd the proper Medicines, it wou'd be requiſite to lay upon each ſide of the Noſe a Triangular Bolſter, cover'd with a little piece of Paſte-board of the ſame Figure. This ſmall Dreſſing is to be ſupported with a kind of Sling that hath four Heads; being a piece of Linnen-Cloath, two Fingers broad, and half an Ell long; it is ſlit at both ends, and all along, only leaving in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a Plain of three Fingers, that is to ſay, a part which is not cut.

               <p>THE Jaw may be luxated either on both ſides, or only on one. When the Diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happens on both ſides, it hangs over the <hi>Sternum</hi> or Breaſt-Bone, and the Spittle runs abundantly out of the Mouth: To reduce it, the Patient muſt ſit down, and his Head is to be ſupported by a Servant; then the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor or Surgeon having wrapt up his two Thumbs, puts 'em into the Mouth upon the Molar Teeth, his other Fingers lying under the Jaw, which is to be drawn down by raiſing it up, having before ſet two ſmall Wooden Wedges upon the two Molar Teeth on both ſides of the Jaw, leſt the Surgeon's Fingers ſhou'd be hurt, as the Bone is returning to its place.</p>
               <p>If the Luxation be forward, a Band or Strap is to be put under the Chin, an Aſſiſtant ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Knees upon the Patient's Shoulders, where he is to draw the Strap upward, to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate the Extenſion; which the Surgeon makes with his Hands, at the ſame time thruſting the Bone back again into its place.</p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:39065:155"/>
               <p>When the Jaw is luxated only on one ſide, the Chin ſtands a-croſs, and the diſlocated ſide is ſquaſh'd down, a ſmall Cavity being perceiv'd in it, and a Riſing on the other ſide; ſo that the Mouth cannot be ſhut cloſe, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remains ſomewhat open, the lower Teeth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear farther out than the upper; and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine or Dog-Teeth lie under the Inciſive.

               <p>When the Luxation is on the fore-part, a Tumour ariſeth in the Groin, ſo that the Patient cannot draw this Thigh toward the other, nor bend the Leg; his Body reſting only upon the Heel.</p>

               <p>To reduce the External Luxation, the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is to be laid upon his Belly; and the drawing to be perform'd after the ſame manner as we have even now ſhewn, whilſt the Thigh is thruſt from the outſide inward, to cauſe the Bone to re-enter its Cavity.</p>
               <p>In reducing the Anterior Luxation, the hurt Perſon is to be laid upon the ſide op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Luxation, and Extenſions are to be made, by drawing both upward and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as before: Then the Head of the Bone is to be forc'd, by the means of a Ball thruſt ſtrongly with the Knee, in drawing the luxated Leg toward the other.</p>

               <p>The Poſterior Luxation is thus reduc'd: The Patient being laid upon his Belly, the double Extenſion is to be made, and his Knee drawn outward, to ſet the Bone in its place.

               <p>The Poſterior Luxation is reduc'd by obliging the Patient to lie upon his Belly, whilſt the Surgeon during the Extenſions bends the Leg, in drawing the Heel toward the top of the Thigh,</p>

                  <p>Let the Gum <hi>Ammoniack, Galbanum, Bdelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and <hi>Opoponax</hi> be diſſolv'd in Vinegar, in a little Earthen Pipkin; ſtrain 'em thro' a courſe Cloth, and let 'em be thicken'd by Evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the Method before obſerv'd in other Plaiſters: Then prepare the Load-Stone upon a Porphyry or Marble-Stone, and take care to bruiſe ſeparately the <hi>Olibanum,</hi> the Maſtick, the Myrrh, the round Birth-Wort, and the Verdegreaſe, which is to be kept to be added at laſt. In the mean while, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated cold the Oil with the Litharge, and mingl'd the Water with 'em, they are to be boil'd together over a very good Fire, ſtirring 'em inceſſantly, till the whole Compoſition hath acquir'd the Conſiſtence of a ſomewhat ſolid
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:39065:172"/>Plaiſter, in which is to be diſſolv'd the yellow Wax cut into ſmall pieces. Afterward having taken off the Pan from the Fire, and left the Ingredients to be half cool'd, intermix the Gums, which have been already thicken'd and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the Turpentine; then the Load-Stone mingl'd with the Birth-Wort, Myrrh, Maſtick, and <hi>Olibanum;</hi> and laſt of all the Verdegreaſe. Thus when all theſe Ingredients are well ſtirr'd and mixt together, the Plaiſter will be entirely compounded; ſo that it may be made up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rolls, and preſerv'd to be us'd upon neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Occaſions.</p>
                  <p>This Plaiſter is efficacious in curing of all kinds of Wounds, Ulcers, Tumours, and Contuſions; for it mollifies, digeſtes, and brings to Suppuration ſuch Matter as ought to be carry'd off this way.
